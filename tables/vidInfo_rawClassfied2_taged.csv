Three years earlier, fluorescein angiography had shown signs of chronic vascular abnormalities primarily in the superior retina, but an expected anterograde flow through the central retinal artery was preserved. Current fluorescein angiography revealed that the central and temporal macula was now being perfused by retrograde flow through a newly formed chorioretinal anastomosis located in a photocoagulation scar. Corrected visual acuity was maintained at 20/20 OU. The laser-induced chorioretinal anastomosis had potentially salved the macula from catastrophic ischemia due to neurofibromatosis-associated retinal arterial occlusive disease.

Intraoperative leakage could lead to the transient collapse of the anterior chamber. With the help of an external slit illuminator, we found significant forward movement of the posterior capsule, iris, and intraocular lens. The posterior capsule or intraocular lens could make contact with the corneal endothelium. In this video, we applied downward pressure on the incision with a cotton swab immediately after the withdrawal of a handpiece tip for about 30 seconds, called swab pressing.

Some outcomes following PnR may be superior to PPV for managing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, based on randomized clinical trial findings.

This animation video illustrates a possible mechanism for the difference in visual acuity outcomes between the 2 procedures based on observations of photoreceptor integrity on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) after 12 months.

PPV involves a gas-fluid exchange. As gas is put into the vitreous cavity, subretinal fluid at the site of detachment is aspirated. The photoreceptor layer re-apposes to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as the fluid is removed [00:08], but cell interdigitation is suboptimal [00:16] and some photoreceptor cells subsequently die off in the process. This is potentially associated with worse visual acuity outcomes and with more discontinuities of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane (ELM) on OCT imaging compared with pneumatic retinopexy.

The tool provides a more convenient alternative to direct contact measure for monitoring eye pressure in patients with or at risk of glaucoma, but the air puff can push the corneal endothelium, iris, and lens together, as seen in this video, which poses the following theoretical risks: 

(1) Cornea-iris contact could lead to release of pigment from the iris into the anterior chamber, which could get into the trabecular meshwork and contribute to flow impairment, elevating intraocular pressure and resulting in a pigmentary glaucoma. 
(2) Iris-lens contact could lead to inflammation and adherence of the iris to the lens, which could lead to impairment of flow of fluid from the posterior to anterior chamber, resulting in a bowing forward of the peripheral iris against the cornea and narrow-angle glaucoma. 
(3) Cornea-lens contact could lead to corneal endothelium damage, clouding vision.

Because development of ocular structures requires proper coordination of hypoxia signaling, researchers evaluated patients with the syndrome for eye abnormalities and developed and evaluated a transgenic mouse model with a somatic heterozygous Epas1A529V mutation (corresponding to the human EPAS1A530V mutation) to establish the role of HIF-2ж┴ in the development of eye pathologies identified in the patients. This video of time-lapse fluorescein angiography demonstrates a venous plexus out towards the periphery of the eye with plexiform arteriovenous shunting (arrow) in a mutant mouse, mimicking some of the findings seen in humans.

DIBhVWsnIH8,lens;cataract;cataracts;iol;capsular;,Dislocated Lenses After Cataract Surgery - Removal and Re-Placement,"Cataract surgery involves replacing the native eye lens with a prosthetic one, but sometimes the newly placed intraocular lens can get dislocated. This procedure video (beginning 00:26) illustrates 
removal of a dislocated acrylic posterior chamber IOL by grasping it with intraocular forceps and directing it to the anterior chamber through a temporal, crescent-shaped posterior capsular opening without disrupting the position of an already-placed IOL.

MkXS3hytF-U,Iris,Surgical Removal of a Free-floating Pigmented Iris Cyst,"A 22-year-old man had perceived a moving black spot in the visual field of his right eye and no other symptoms for 1 year. An eye examination revealed perfect vision (visual acuity 20/20 in both eyes) and slitlamp examination findings of the right eye identified an oval lesion, 2 mm in thickness by 2 mm in diameter, translucent and brown, that changed its location with head posture.

The patient was diagnosed with a free-floating pigmented iris cyst that was surgically removed as illustrated in this video.

It is fine for a tube to be placed against the iris! Placing a tube against the iris does NOT cause uveitis or any significant clinical problem.

Postoperative hypotony after a Paul Glaucoma Implant is fortunately uncommon but, when it develops from tube overdrainage, my preference is external subconjunctival ligation with 10-0 nylon, assuming that a ripcord is already in place. The ligatures can be lasered later, if required. Intra-cameral ligation is an alternative strategy, but requires externalisation of the tube, which is ligated and then reinserted into the AC. These 2 x 8-0 nylon were applied by a colleague in a patient with uveitic glaucoma and have kept the IOP at 18mmHg on Cosopt, which is satisfactory for this patient.

Eventually, the tube is in the pupil peak in the sulcus, just in front of the lens, but postoperatively slips just behind the pupil margin again. The risk to the lens from the tube touching is much less than widely perceived, assuming care is taken to keep the needle entry away from the lens. Uncontrolled glaucoma is the greatest risk to vision.

This eye also has a prior superotemporal Baerveldt which is very corneal as there is no space in the AC and it has not been placed in the sulcus.

raJfEqq3Mjg,cornea;iol;glaucoma;,Implanting a Paul Glaucoma Implant in a Single Chamber Eye with a Pre-existing Anterior Chamber IOL,"Tubes in non-vitrectomised single chamber eyes are prone to block with vitreous. In this situation, a pre-existing anterior chamber IOL can be useful to keep vitreous out of the tube, as long as the tube is long enough to sit in front of the IOL without flipping behind. 

The problem is that with a relatively posterior entry site in the anterior chamber, which is the ideal position to keep the tube away from cornea, the tube will  go behind the IOL, unless flipped in front of it and long enough in the anterior chamber to stay there.

This 20 year old was with aniridia has had Paul Glaucoma Implants in place for 16 months. The right is in constant contact with the peripheral lens capsule and the left intermittently.

Also look at the abnormally thick scleral spur (highlighted by an arrow at 40 secs).

A classic is when the tube hits the peripheral capsule or IOL haptic on the way in and ends up in the vitreous behind the IOL, as seen here. 

Sometimes using an instrument or visco to depress the IOL, can flip the tube forward into the sulcus. In this case, I've hooked it and flipped it forward with the BSS cannula. All good in the end!

The AGV was eventually removed from the AC and the tip can be seen near the limbus. Whether tubes, trabs, Xen or Preserflo, it is a mistake to persist with repetitive MMC needling as it rarely fixes the problem and renders the quadrant completely unusable. The conjunctiva, tenons and sclera in this quadrant have become a complete white-out. If unlucky, the patient will also develop limbal stem cell deficiency. The alternatve would have been to replace the implant earlier, with a Baerveldt or Paul. The patient was referred with unctrolled IOP which is now well-controlled with a second infero-nasal Paul Glaucoma Implant.

Blind sulcus fixation is becoming increasingly popular and I would strongly advise against this.

Always make sure you can see the tip, even if it is only on gonioscopy!

One of my favorite sayings is б░Prior prevention prevents poor performance.б▒
I have found that practicing all of these principles will help people to succeed.
But at the same time, stuff happensбнlife happens.
Things donбпt always work-out as we plan them.
This case is a perfect illustration of how life happens.
This patient is undergoing laser cataract surgery  with planned placement of a panoptix lens implant.
His pre-operative measurements:
UCVA 20/200 J32
The capsulorhexis was created with the femtosecond laser
The  cataract was removed safely.
Removal of cortex via irrigation and aspiration was routine.
Here we are at 5 minutes into the surgery.
We place the panoptix lens into the capsular bag.
The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.
The panoptix lens was perfectly centered at the end of the case as we can see the reflection of the Lumera microscrope lights centered on the central optic of the panoptix lens at the end of the procedure.
The next day, the patient comes-in for their follow-up visit.
The eye looks perfect thankfully.  The panoptix is perfectly centered.
The patientбпs vision is UCVA 20/20 J1+.  Refraction is -0.25 sphere.  IOP is 12 mm Hg.
So, sometimes life happensбнthings donбпt go as planned.

BjHHuzK5fuU,lens;cataract;iol;capsular;,"Why do I see a shadow, crescent or arc after cataract surgery? Treatment of Negative Dysphotopsia.","Why do I see a shadow to the side of my vision after cataract surgery?

In our practice, we inform 100% of our patients that undergo cataract surgery that they will experience 4 common symptoms on the first day after their surgery:
1 slightly blurred vision
2 a scratchy sensation like an eyelash is rubbing their eye
3 a flicker or quiver to their vision
4 a dark shadow out to the side.

This last symptom is also known as б░Negative Dysphotopsia.б▒

Patients with negative dysphotopsia classically share the following history:
б░I see a dark shadow or arc out to the side.  It is curved like a semi-circle or crescent shape.  And when I place my hand like this (out to the side), the shadow goes away.б▒

The typical evolution of the negative dysphotopsia is that it goes away within 1-2 months as the eye heals and the brain adapts to seeing through the new lens implant.

Rarely, however some patients will have a persistent crescent or shadow that does not fully resolve and may persist indefinitely.  Most of these patients however state that the shadow is so subtle that it does not bother them or affect their quality of life.

For less than one-half of one percent of patients иC probably closer to one in 5000 patients иC they are severely bothered by the negative dysphotopsia that persists and does not go away.

What causes negative dysphotopsia?

First of all, ND typically occurs when the surgical procedure has been performed normally and the surgical result is normal without any complications whatsoever.

Some patients may ask, did something go wrong?  The answer is б░your surgery was routine and you are experiencing a normal unavoidable side effect that should go away with timeбнusually within one or two months.б▒

There are Two factors associated with ND:
1 The design of the edge of the intraocular lens иC show the edge of the IOL
2 The space between the lens and the iris иC show a graphic

The best treatment is prevention.  We have found that the lens that creates this side effect the least often in my experience is the Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lens. This is our standard basic monofocal lens used in basic cataract surgery in our practice.  It is a 3 piece lens that due to itбпs design simply does not cause much negative dysphotopsia.

To date, I have placed over 5000 Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lenses and have had 1 or 2 patients state that they have persistent negative dysphotopsia.  Neither of these patients required additional treatment of their ND because their symptoms were relatively mild and tolerable.

Now, the most commonly used lens type used by most ophthalmologists is the б░Single piece acrylic (SPA) lens.б▒

This lens design is used in the vast majority of basic, astigmatism-correcting or toric lenses, and premium presbyopia-correcting lenses.

So all of our patients who receive a premium presbyopia-correcting lens or an astigmatism-correcting lens in our practice will receive a single-piece acrylic lens.

This lens design in my experience is associated with a higher rate of negative dysphotopsia than the LI61AO.

Letбпs talk about the worst case scenario: The patient has negative dysphotopsia, is very bothered by it, and the symptom иC crescent/arc/shadow иC is present all the time and is not getting better after waiting 3 months or more.

Then there are in my opinion 3 options:
1 If the patient has a SPA, then remove the SPA and replace it with an LI61AO lens.  In my experience, that treatment works almost every time.
2 If the patient has a lens inside the bag, then we can place a lens between the bag and the iris into the ciliary sulcus иC moving it closer to the front of the eye and decreasing the space between the lens and the iris.
3 What if the patient however has a premium single piece acrylic IOL that is correcting both presbyopia and astigmatism and is only designed to be placed in the capsular bag?
a. Piggyback IOL in the sulcus
b. Reverse optic capture.

So let me present this case to you of a patient who had persistent very bothersome negative dysphotopsia.

This is a 49 year old gentleman who had lens replacement surgery on 11/11/19 with a panoptix toric lens.  
His UCVA and MR on 11/2/19 were: 
20/40 J16
MR: -0.25+2.00x105 20/20
The original surgery was routine and uncomplicated. 4 months postoperatively he reported the classic symptoms of ND including that he could б░constantly see the edge of the lens.б▒  He was very bothered.  So we performed Reverse optic capture on 4/29/2020.

His UCVA and refraction on the day of his IOL reposition:
UCVA 20/30 J2
MR: -0.25+1.00x115

The patient on POD1 was amazed with his vision.  The ND and edge of the lens effect were completely gone and his vision was improved as well.

UCVA 20/20 J1+

LLz_NYddlLg,lens;cataract;capsular;,Is Cataract Surgery Boring? Panoptix with an open posterior capsule. Posterior capsulorhexis.,"Is cataract surgery boring?

After all, we are just removing and replacing the natural lens with a lens implantбн.and we do it over and over thousands of times during the career of an ophthalmologist.

The short answer in my experience is, б░No.  It never gets boring.б▒

Why?

Because if you really care about doing great work, then there is a drive for perfection.  With cataract surgery, the goals are actually very diverse and involve a varied skill set.  For each surgical procedure we have to answer many questions:
1 Can I achieve as perfect an outcome as possible using techniques and tricks that I have acquired and learned over my lifetime?
2 Can I finish this task as efficiently as possible with the least amount of wasted time, materials and complete it with optimal safety?
3 How can I perform this task better now than I have in the past?
4 When unusual situations arise, can I problem solve to finish the mission safely?
5 When we encounter stressful situations, can I control my emotions to complete the mission while managing my surgical team and making sure the patient experience is smooth?

Itбпs easy to think.  This procedure is so routine that it must get repetitive and redundant and boring.

If it getбпs boring, then the operator has plateaued in their skills and has reached a period of complacency and stagnation.

If surgery was repetitive and redundant, then robots could perform surgery.

They canбпt.

Why?  Because despite perfect planning and preparation, Murphy always shows-up.

This case illustrates that concept.

This is a 64 year old patient who is having Laser Lens Replacement with the panoptix toric lens to correct his presbyopia and astigmatism and to enable him to see far, mid and near without glasses.

His preoperative vision without glasses:
20/30 far and J5 (or 20/40 near)

His refraction:
+0.50+2.00x180 20/20

This is the appearance of the eye on POD 1.

His postoperative vision without glasses:
20/25 far and J1 (or 20/25 near)

His refraction:
Plano

Most importantly, he is happy with his vision without glasses and can now read comfortably without glasses from his eye with the panoptix lens.  Based on his positive experience and improved vision, he now chooses to have his second eye corrected one week later with the same type of lens implant.

So, cataract surgery never seems boring.  It is a constant challenge to master the technical, emotional and human skills that will create the safest, most efficient and best visual outcome that will ultimately make the patient happy so they can experience the rest of their lives with the best vision possible.

But it is the mindset that makes it challenging and interesting.  From my perspective, each surgical case is an opportunity to:
1 improve someoneбпs life by improving their visionбнat itбпs core иC helping people
2 improve the team working with me by sharing knowledge 
3 improve myself by challenging myself to perfect the array of skills necessary to create the best experience for the patient and the team

There are so many variables that we have to manage during cataract surgery. One of these variables involves taking risks.  Everything in life including surgery has risks.  But in order to achieve the greatest rewards in life, you have to take risks.  And by taking risks, we ultimately learn to solve problems that make us better surgeons and allow us to deliver the best possible care for our patients.",panoptix posterior capsule tear,single piece acrylic lens in capsular bad with posterior capsule break or tear,posterior capsulorhexis,little maneuver,capsulorhexis rescue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of negative dysphotopsia involves moving the intraocular lens (or IOL) optic from inside of the capsular bag anteriorly to place the optic anterior to the anterior capsular leaflets while keeping the IOL haptics inside the capsular bag in a procedure known as reverse optic capture.

To achieve reverse capture or ROC, we extricate the IOL from inside the capsular bag, then gently reposition it to make sure the haptics remain inside the capsular bag while the optic is now anterior or in front of the anterior capsular rim.

In my experience, ROC cures negative dysphotopsia in over 90% of cases.

From June-November 2021, I placed 400 Synergy lens implants for patients seeking premium cataract surgery and premium lens replacement.  The vast majority of patients with the synergy lens see quite well.  

A significant percentage of patients with the synergy lens will however not  see as well as they want - particularly with vision far away - to a degree that they find their vision unacceptable.  If a patient with the synergy lens finds their vision unacceptable, then sometimes the best remedy is the perform intraocular lens exchange to remove the synergy and replace it with an alternative lens implant such as the panoptix, vivity or a monofocal lens implant.

In this video, we share a patient's perspective with her vision with bilateral synergy lenses and then her vision after intraocular lens exchange where we removed her synergy lenses and replaced them with bilateral panoptix lens implants.

But like all things in life, the best outcomes go to those that pay attention to detail and remain humble in their approach to processes and life.

We show how routine irrigation and aspiration can have problems and how we identify and solve these problems.  This silicone tip I/A has a crack on the posterior or back surface .  The posterior capsule therefore can be aspirated by the opening in the posterior surface of the IA tip directly opposite the side of the normal aspiration port.  The posterior capsule can become incarcerated in the back/posterior surface of the IA tip and if this situation is not identified quickly, then the posterior capsule can be torn leading to vitreous loss complications associated with an open posterior capsule.

However with rapid identification of this situation, the problem can be managed without difficulty.

0u_Nja0w3W8,lens;chopper;cataract;iol;capsular;,The Bausch and Lomb LI61AO Bent Haptic.  How we fix it.,"Our go-to monofocal lens is the Bausch and Lomb LI61AO.

The optics are spectacular.

There is on occasion an issue where the haptics might be bent during insertion of the lens.

When this situation happens, here is how I typically fix this situation.

In this case, the leading haptic is trapped between the optic and the injector causing the leading haptic to be bent.

If we place the lens into the capsular bag with a bent haptic, the lens will be decentered.

Because the LI61AO is an aspheric lens, small amounts of lens decentration are inconsequential.

But we still want the lens to be as centered as possible.

So we use our lens chopper to rotate the IOL to bring the bent haptic close to the primary incision, then tease the haptic out of the eye.

Then using two forceps, we bend the haptic back into the normal conformation.

Once the haptic shape is normalized, then we place the IOL and haptics back into the capsular bag.

During irrigation and aspiration we confirm that the IOL is well centered.

Iбпve performed this maneuver hundreds of times over the past decade and have not noticed any long-term issues with these patients.  The lens seems to stay very well centered long-term.

I hope this video helps give you a solution if you encounter this situation during cataract surgery.

Reverse optic capture intraocular lens exchange after YAG Capsulotomy.,"This patient had a panoptix implant placed in reverse-optic-capture (ROC) configuration where the optic was anterior to the anterior capsule and the haptics were posterior to the anterior capsule because she had initially received an IC-8 Apthera lens that she did not like.  

The patient had a YAG capsulotomy after having the IC8 lens placed and did not like her vision after YAG capsulotomy with the IC8.

She underwent Intraocular lens exchange (removed the IC8 lens) after YAG capsulotomy.  A panoptix lens was placed in ROC.

She was a refractive miss and then had PRK to correct her residual refractive error.  

She ended-up hyperopic after a small PRK procedure.

Because she could see well with the panoptix through her manifest refraction and because she did not respond predictably to the prior PRK, we decided to perform another ROC IOLX with a different power panoptix lens.

zQQaOfDbw1w,lens;capsular;,"Subluxed Multifocal Lens Implant - The Choices We Make Define Who We Are.  Shannon Wong, MD","We all have choices in life.  One dilemma we all face daily is when we want to do something that we are not supposed to do, how we find a way keep ourselves from doing it.  Another similar dilemma is when we see something that we don't want to do but we know we are supposed to do it, how do we find a way to make ourselves do it anyway.

When confronted with difficult surgical problems in ophthalmology, it is easier to choose the least stressful path.  We may even rationalize that we are acting in the best interests of the patient by not offering a service that may be complex or challenging.

There is a saying that I am reminded of, ""There is no growth in the comfort zone.""

In order to realize our greatest potential, we have to push ourselves to take on and endure difficult challenges and overcome them.  Through the process of great effort, we emerge stronger and better in most ways imaginable.  Similarly, by taking the easier path and staying in our own comfort zones we resign ourselves and those around us to remain average.

We present a challenging case involving a patient who has a subluxed synergy multifocal lens. The original surgeons recommended removing the multifocal lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.  Although intraocular lens exchange and replacement with a monofocal lens is easier from a technical perspective than repositioning the patient's existing multifocal lens, the patient wanted to maintain the full-range of focus that he could achieve only with a multifocal lens.

Therefore he traveled to see us for repositioning of his synergy lens implant.  We used 2 Ahmed capsular tension segments and a capsular tension ring fixated to the sclera with Goretex sutures to reposition and center this patient's synergy lens.

The patient had a great outcome.

Ahmed, MD, FRCSC, presents the key features and some of the surgical pearls of using the Ahmed Capsular Tension Segment (CTS).
Unlike CTRs, this exclusive CTS is used for scleral fixation and indicated for patients with extensive and/or progressive zonular loss. 

The CTS can be used in cases where an anterior or posterior capsular tear or a discontinuous capsulorhexis is present, as it does not generate a 360o expansile force. Multiple segments can be used if necessary. The CTS provides support in the area of fixation. It has to be combined with a CTR when circumferential support is required. The CTS may also be used for intraoperative support and removed prior to completion of the surgery.

r8QT2vjbFxc,lacrimal;lacrimal intubation;nasolacrimal;,FCI Nunchaku? | In-Office Procedure | Exclusive | FCI Lacrimal,"In this video, Doctor Kenneth V. Cahill, Columbus, Ohio, shares his experience using FCIбпs Nunchaku? as an in-office procedure. According to him, this option is cost effective for both the patient and surgeon, as it avoids going to the surgery center or the hospital.

Detailed procedure from 0,49 mn to 3,18 mn.

We would like to thank Doctor Kenneth V. Cahill for his contribution to this video.

FCI Nunchaku? is a pushed silicone self-retaining bicanalicular nasolacrimal intubation stent that acts like a conformer, allowing tears to be drained by capillarity. The metallic guides are located inside the lumen, not as an extension of the stent as in conventional intubation sets. Therefore, no nasal retrieval is needed.

o4l29kfM2CE,lens;cataract;,"Thoughts on robotic surgery. Can robots perform surgery? Shannon Wong, MD","Itбпs 2020, Tesla cars are attempting to enable fully autonomous drivingбнdriving via AI without humans , 5G high speed internet is emerging, and robots are becoming more and more evolved.

What if bots could do cataract surgery?  What AI would they need?  What are the myriad of decisions that would need to be considered in order to safely perform cataract surgery? 

As an eye surgeon, we perform a surgical procedure иC cataract or lens replacement surgery - that for most experienced surgeons takes 7-10 minutes to complete.  It is a routine, very safe procedure.  I often wonder as I am workingбнwill robots be able to replace me and do what I do one day in the future?  If so, when.  What would be needed to make cataract surgery fully autonomous by robots?

I think to myself, I have 25 years and 15,000 cataract procedures of experience inside my brain.  If other experts could share their experience and we could combine our collective experience and expertise from surgeons worldwide and apply it to a robot, then the robot would theoretically be able to perform surgery as well if not better than a human.

Itбпs like if you could combine the skills of Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Kobe Bryant into one robot, then that robot would have abilities above and beyond any one of the players individually.

In order for a bot to replace humans doing surgery, we would need a combination of:
1 Robotic hands that are more facile and dexterous than a human
2 An extremely powerful and fast computer using Artificial intelligence that could combine the experience and expertise of the best surgeons in the world and apply it to direct the robotic hands to complete the surgical steps
3 A camera system that has a FPS of at least 120 frames per second

If you have ever seen the terminator you may have seen the heads-up display that the terminator uses to show the analysis of information that the terminator (a cyborg) is receiving and analyzing in real-time.

So, in this video, I will show you my heads-up display and what I am thinking in my videoбн.like the heads-up display seen in the terminator.  Personally, I donбпt envision bots doing eye surgery in the next 20 years.  But I will show you the myriad of decisions that would need to be made by a bot doing surgery. 

Humans as of 2020 are more capable than machines at dynamic interaction to a constantly changing environment.  Surgery requires uniquely human emotional qualities combined with technical maneuvers to successfully and safely complete the procedure.

The risk of complications that will affect vision during surgery performed by humans is less than 1%.  Bots would have to prove to be better and safer and more cost efficient than humans in the future to supplant eye surgery performed by people on other people.

Do I think that robots will be doing surgery in the next 20 years?  Itбпs highly unlikely in my opinion.  The types of  adjustments that have to be made in real time are complex and random.

I do believe that autonomous driving will become a reality in the next 10 years and that AI and 5G will change our lives for the better.  But for the foreseeable future, I think your surgery will still be performed by humans, physicians and surgeons.",robotic surgery,bots performing surgery,robots in medicine,artificial intelligence in medicine,machines performing surgery,cataract surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yyBlA3a9xLQ,lens;cataract;capsular;,How I polish the posterior capsule during cataract and lens replacement surgery - The Capsule Guard.,"For each cataract or lens replacement surgery, we remove the cortex then are left with these small cortical fibers that are adherent to the posterior capsule.

Over the past year, we have been using the capsule guard which is a single-use irrigation and aspiration instrument as our go-to device.  The capsule guard is the most capsule-friendly I/A device that I have used in my career.

To polish the posterior capsule, I directly aspirate the posterior capsular fibers under low vacuum.  I am careful to only move the aspiration tip and aspirate the posterior capsule moving in a linear or curvilinear motion from bottom to top or side-to-side.  I do not aspirate moving from top to bottom or aspirate in two directions in order to avoid inadvertently tearing the posterior capsule.

Using this instrument with this technique has proven to be extremely safe and effective for creating the clearest posterior capsules possible during cataract and lens replacement surgery.

5cca7rBIfcE,lens;cataract;capsular;,"Life Happens...Panoptix insertion with capsule break during surgery.  Shannon Wong, MD. 2-8-2020","Sometimesбн.in factбн.many timesбнlife just happens.
We try to perfect our lives, prevent problems, be perfectionistic, be proactive.
One of my favorite sayings is б░Prior prevention prevents poor performance.б▒
I have found that practicing all of these principles will help people to succeed.
But at the same time, stuff happensбнlife happens.
Things donбпt always work-out as we plan them.
This case is a perfect illustration of how life happens.
This patient is undergoing laser cataract surgery  with planned placement of a panoptix lens implant.
His pre-operative measurements:
UCVA 20/200 J32
The capsulorhexis was created with the femtosecond laser
The  cataract was removed safely.
Removal of cortex via irrigation and aspiration was routine.
Here we are at 5 minutes into the surgery.
We place the panoptix lens into the capsular bag.
The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.
The panoptix lens was perfectly centered at the end of the case as we can see the reflection of the Lumera microscrope lights centered on the central optic of the panoptix lens at the end of the procedure.
The next day, the patient comes-in for their follow-up visit.
The eye looks perfect thankfully.  The panoptix is perfectly centered.
The patientбпs vision is UCVA 20/20 J1+.  Refraction is -0.25 sphere.  IOP is 12 mm Hg.
So, sometimes life happensбнthings donбпt go as planned.  
It is how we respond to these daily situations that will define victory or defeat.
On a daily basis, we have to stand-by to get some.  Life happens.
Thank you for watching.  Have a wonderful day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Symfony lens is a presbyopia-correcting lens implant that successfully corrects vision at all distances - far, mid and near - enabling patients to see with minimal to no reliance on glasses.

It works well in 99+% of patients in our experience thus far.  Since no lens implant is perfect and without side effects, there are patients who may not like the quality or quantity of vision with the Symfony.

We present a case of lens exchange (IOL exchange) where we removed the symfony lens and replaced it with a panoptix lens after the patient had undergone prior YAG laser capsulotomy.  The patient did not like the vision with the Symfony but was satisfied with the vision of the PanOptix lens.  She preferred the range of focus with the PanOptix lens more than the Symfony lens.

zQQaOfDbw1w,lens;capsular;,"Subluxed Multifocal Lens Implant - The Choices We Make Define Who We Are.  Shannon Wong, MD","We all have choices in life.  One dilemma we all face daily is when we want to do something that we are not supposed to do, how we find a way keep ourselves from doing it.  Another similar dilemma is when we see something that we don't want to do but we know we are supposed to do it, how do we find a way to make ourselves do it anyway.

When confronted with difficult surgical problems in ophthalmology, it is easier to choose the least stressful path.  We may even rationalize that we are acting in the best interests of the patient by not offering a service that may be complex or challenging.

There is a saying that I am reminded of, ""There is no growth in the comfort zone.""

In order to realize our greatest potential, we have to push ourselves to take on and endure difficult challenges and overcome them.  Through the process of great effort, we emerge stronger and better in most ways imaginable.  Similarly, by taking the easier path and staying in our own comfort zones we resign ourselves and those around us to remain average.

We present a challenging case involving a patient who has a subluxed synergy multifocal lens. The original surgeons recommended removing the multifocal lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.  Although intraocular lens exchange and replacement with a monofocal lens is easier from a technical perspective than repositioning the patient's existing multifocal lens, the patient wanted to maintain the full-range of focus that he could achieve only with a multifocal lens.

Therefore he traveled to see us for repositioning of his synergy lens implant.  We used 2 Ahmed capsular tension segments and a capsular tension ring fixated to the sclera with Goretex sutures to reposition and center this patient's synergy lens.

The patient had a great outcome.

I have no financial interests in the products discussed in this video.

Individuals who receive the ICL (also known as the Evo ICL) to correct extreme nearsightedness or myopia will eventually need to have their ICLбпs removed when they undergo cataract surgery.

This patient received the ICL 7 years ago in 2016.  He developed a cataract after undergoing vitrectomy surgery to treat a retina detachment.

He was a -13.0 D myope with a 30.0 mm axial length prior to receiving the ICL

To remove the ICL we fill the eye with anesthetic and viscoelastic, then use a sinskey hook to push the ICL footplates out of the ciliary sulcus.

Then using microforceps and a 0.12 forcep with teeth we gently remove the ICL by applying traction in a hand-over-hand technique to explant the ICL.

In this case, the ICL was removed in one piece.

We then remove this patientбпs cataract in a normal manner.

Using utrata forceps we create a 5.0 mm capsulorhexis, then remove the cataract safely.

After the cortex is removed we gently polish the posterior capsule to remove any residual lens cells.

Viscoelastic is used to expand the capsular bag and to viscodilate the pupil.

A capsule polisher is used to remove lens cells from the posterior surface of the anterior capsule.

Our panoptix lens is then inserted into the capsular bag.  Viscoelastic is removed from in front of and behind the implant while the implant is also rotated into correct alignment as this is a toric panoptix lens.

Once the lens is properly aligned and viscoelastic has been removed from behind the IOL, we use healon GV to fill the anterior chamber.

Because this is a 30.0 mm axial length eye, the preoperative biometry calls for a +4.0 D panoptix.  Since the lowest power panoptix is a +6.0, we insert a -2.0 D lens into the ciliary sulcus in a piggyback configuration to bring this patient to emmetropia.

We use viscoelastic to viscodilate the pupil to facilitate placement of the haptics into the sulcus.

We then remove all viscoelastic from between the two lens implants and the anterior chamber.

Finally we hydrate our corneal incisions to make sure they are self sealing.

This patient could see normally the following day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absolutely! Combining different lens implant designs between the right and left eyes of the same person can and does work well. 

We share a patient example who had the panoptix in one eye and the Vivity in the second eye to achieve his best vision without glasses at all distances.

This patient initially had the panoptix lens placed in both eyes.  He was unsatisfied with his vision.  We then performed an intraocular lens exchange - removed his panoptix in one eye and placed a Vivity lens in the eye - to help his see the way he wanted.  Additionally he noted seeing a persistent dark crescent to the side of his field of vision known as negative dysphotopsia.  We treated his negative dysphotopsia with reverse optic capture successfully.

Shannon Wong, MD","Lens implant glistenings or sub surface nano glistenings (SSNG) are small fluid filled vacuoles that can develop within an intraocular lens optic made of hydrophobic acrylic.

The most commonly used lens implants in the US are the alcon acrylic lens implants.  These lens implants have been used in millions of patients for more than 2 decades.  The vast majority of patients with these lenses have outstanding visual outcomes even if the lens implants develop visible lens glistenings.

We have been using the alcon acrylic lenses since the 1990бпs, Iбпve seen tens of thousands of these lens implants in my career and removed none of them because of visually significant glisteningsбн.until we saw our patient Jack in December 2023.

odGyovs3CXg,lens;iol;capsular;retinal;vitrectomy;vitrectomy;anterior vitrectomy;,"Intraocular Lens Exchange of single piece acrylic lenses after YAG capsulotomy. Shannon Wong, MD.","We  encounter this scenario every week in our practice.  
The vast majority of these patients have received a presbyopia-correcting lens implant and want a different presbyopia-correcting lens implant.
During the preoperative exam, we determine if an intraocular lens exchange is the appropriate solution to help the patient achieve their visual goals.
Then we dilate the pupil to make sure that the anterior capsulorhexis is 
1 well-centered and 
2 between 4.5 to 5.0 mm in diameter and 
3 if there is 360 degrees of anterior capsule overlap of the lens optic.
It is helpful to obtain an accurate manifest refraction of the patientбпs eyes and if possible to know the lens implant type and power.  Though it is not required, having the preoperative biometry is also very helpful in selecting the appropriate power for the replacement IOL.

Intraocular lens exchange is performed in our usual manner:  
1 topical anesthetic augmented with intraocular lidocaine and oral valium 10mg.  We do not use IV sedation.
2 Once the anterior chamber is filled with healon GV, we elevate the anterior capsular rim and viscodissect the IOL from the capsular bag
3 The IOL haptics are viscodissected from the equator of the capsular bag, then the IOL is rotated into the anterior chamber, cut with IOL cutters and removed in two pieces.
4 An anterior vitrectomy is performed.
5 Insertion of the replacement IOL involves placement of the IOL anterior to the anterior capsule, then we hold the edge of the optic with microforceps and use a connor wand to maneuver the lens haptics posterior to the anterior capsular rim.
6 The lens optic is then maneuvered posterior to the anterior capsule.
7 Once the entire lens implant is posterior to the anterior capsule, the optic edge held by the forceps is brought anterior to the anterior capsular rim.
8 Next, a Connor wand is placed posterior to the optic then maneuvered to lift the opposite edge of the optic anterior to the anterior capsule.
9 Then the microforceps and connor wand are used to lift and center the IOL optic so it has adequate support from the anterior capsule on both sides perpendicular to the haptics that are posterior to the anterior capsule.
10 Once the replacement single piece acrylic lens Is in reverse optic capture and the IOL is deemed to be centered and stable, the viscoelastic is removed from the eye using BSS flushed through 27 ga cannulas.  
11 Do not perform I/A to remove viscoelastic from the anterior chamber if the IOL is in ROC and there is no capsular support.  Whenever I have tried I/A even when lowering the infusion pressure to the lowest setting, I have caused dislocation of the IOL into the vitreous which can potentially necessitate referral of the patient to our retinal colleagues.
Following this process, I have found that IOLX of SPA IOLs after YAG capsulotomy has become a common and very safe procedure in our practice.  We have been able to help many patients who had presbyopia correcting lens implants that were miserable very happy with this procedure.

After our first 300+ panoptix cases we are finding that the Panoptix lens can be used in exchange for a symfony lens to provide better reading vision for patients that are unable to read as well as they want.

LLz_NYddlLg,lens;cataract;capsular;,Is Cataract Surgery Boring? Panoptix with an open posterior capsule. Posterior capsulorhexis.,"Is cataract surgery boring?

After all, we are just removing and replacing the natural lens with a lens implantбн.and we do it over and over thousands of times during the career of an ophthalmologist.

The short answer in my experience is, б░No.  It never gets boring.б▒

Why?

Because if you really care about doing great work, then there is a drive for perfection.  With cataract surgery, the goals are actually very diverse and involve a varied skill set.  For each surgical procedure we have to answer many questions:
1 Can I achieve as perfect an outcome as possible using techniques and tricks that I have acquired and learned over my lifetime?
2 Can I finish this task as efficiently as possible with the least amount of wasted time, materials and complete it with optimal safety?
3 How can I perform this task better now than I have in the past?
4 When unusual situations arise, can I problem solve to finish the mission safely?
5 When we encounter stressful situations, can I control my emotions to complete the mission while managing my surgical team and making sure the patient experience is smooth?

Itбпs easy to think.  This procedure is so routine that it must get repetitive and redundant and boring.

If it getбпs boring, then the operator has plateaued in their skills and has reached a period of complacency and stagnation.

If surgery was repetitive and redundant, then robots could perform surgery.

They canбпt.

Why?  Because despite perfect planning and preparation, Murphy always shows-up.

This case illustrates that concept.

This is a 64 year old patient who is having Laser Lens Replacement with the panoptix toric lens to correct his presbyopia and astigmatism and to enable him to see far, mid and near without glasses.

His preoperative vision without glasses:
20/30 far and J5 (or 20/40 near)

His refraction:
+0.50+2.00x180 20/20

This is the appearance of the eye on POD 1.

His postoperative vision without glasses:
20/25 far and J1 (or 20/25 near)

His refraction:
Plano

Most importantly, he is happy with his vision without glasses and can now read comfortably without glasses from his eye with the panoptix lens.  Based on his positive experience and improved vision, he now chooses to have his second eye corrected one week later with the same type of lens implant.

So, cataract surgery never seems boring.  It is a constant challenge to master the technical, emotional and human skills that will create the safest, most efficient and best visual outcome that will ultimately make the patient happy so they can experience the rest of their lives with the best vision possible.

But it is the mindset that makes it challenging and interesting.  From my perspective, each surgical case is an opportunity to:
1 improve someoneбпs life by improving their visionбнat itбпs core иC helping people
2 improve the team working with me by sharing knowledge 
3 improve myself by challenging myself to perfect the array of skills necessary to create the best experience for the patient and the team

There are so many variables that we have to manage during cataract surgery. One of these variables involves taking risks.  Everything in life including surgery has risks.  But in order to achieve the greatest rewards in life, you have to take risks.  And by taking risks, we ultimately learn to solve problems that make us better surgeons and allow us to deliver the best possible care for our patients.",panoptix posterior capsule tear,single piece acrylic lens in capsular bad with posterior capsule break or tear,posterior capsulorhexis,little maneuver,capsulorhexis rescue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From June-November 2021, I placed 400 Synergy lens implants for patients seeking premium cataract surgery and premium lens replacement.  The vast majority of patients with the synergy lens see quite well.  

A significant percentage of patients with the synergy lens will however not  see as well as they want - particularly with vision far away - to a degree that they find their vision unacceptable.  If a patient with the synergy lens finds their vision unacceptable, then sometimes the best remedy is the perform intraocular lens exchange to remove the synergy and replace it with an alternative lens implant such as the panoptix, vivity or a monofocal lens implant.

In this video, we share a patient's perspective with her vision with bilateral synergy lenses and then her vision after intraocular lens exchange where we removed her synergy lenses and replaced them with bilateral panoptix lens implants.

Individuals who receive the ICL (also known as the Evo ICL) to correct extreme nearsightedness or myopia will eventually need to have their ICLбпs removed when they undergo cataract surgery.

This patient received the ICL 7 years ago in 2016.  He developed a cataract after undergoing vitrectomy surgery to treat a retina detachment.

He was a -13.0 D myope with a 30.0 mm axial length prior to receiving the ICL

To remove the ICL we fill the eye with anesthetic and viscoelastic, then use a sinskey hook to push the ICL footplates out of the ciliary sulcus.

Then using microforceps and a 0.12 forcep with teeth we gently remove the ICL by applying traction in a hand-over-hand technique to explant the ICL.

In this case, the ICL was removed in one piece.

We then remove this patientбпs cataract in a normal manner.

Using utrata forceps we create a 5.0 mm capsulorhexis, then remove the cataract safely.

After the cortex is removed we gently polish the posterior capsule to remove any residual lens cells.

Viscoelastic is used to expand the capsular bag and to viscodilate the pupil.

A capsule polisher is used to remove lens cells from the posterior surface of the anterior capsule.

Our panoptix lens is then inserted into the capsular bag.  Viscoelastic is removed from in front of and behind the implant while the implant is also rotated into correct alignment as this is a toric panoptix lens.

Once the lens is properly aligned and viscoelastic has been removed from behind the IOL, we use healon GV to fill the anterior chamber.

Because this is a 30.0 mm axial length eye, the preoperative biometry calls for a +4.0 D panoptix.  Since the lowest power panoptix is a +6.0, we insert a -2.0 D lens into the ciliary sulcus in a piggyback configuration to bring this patient to emmetropia.

We use viscoelastic to viscodilate the pupil to facilitate placement of the haptics into the sulcus.

We then remove all viscoelastic from between the two lens implants and the anterior chamber.

Finally we hydrate our corneal incisions to make sure they are self sealing.

Zooming in on the filtering ring which is embedded within the clear acrylic material of the lens, we see that the ring has a slightly porous consistency with thousands of tiny holes within the ring.

Iбпve tried various ways to remedy this problem иC using various instruments to push or pull the haptic away from the optic.

Ultimately, the solution is the indirect approach.  Using balanced salt solution on a 3 ml syringe with a 27 ga cannula, I simply inject BSS aimed at the point where the haptic is stuck to the optic.  Usually within about 5 seconds, the haptic will separate from the optic.

Here is a second case using the same technique.  Since most surgeons already have BSS in a syringe and a 27 ga cannula, this step is simple and easy to perform and solve this minor inconvenience.

The light adjustable lens or б░LALб▒ enables patients to see far/mid and near with minimal halo effect at night when implanted into both eyes.

The LAL works well but involves more visits to our office than all of the other lens implants that we use.  

If you choose the LAL, immediately after surgery and for the first 3 weeks after surgery, you will see well far away but will need to use reading glasses.  Additionally during the first 2 months after surgery, you will be required to wear these UV blocking glasses during the daytime when outdoors.  They donбпt need to be worn indoors.

Starting 3 weeks after receiving the LAL, we use this Light delivery device to adjust and customize the focus of the LAL to improve the reading vision in one or both eyes.

So starting 3 weeks after receiving the LAL, in addition to seeing clearly far away without glasses you start seeing better close-up and at mid-range.  We adjust the focus, have you test drive your vision in the real world for one week, then if another treatment or two is needed adjust how you see, we perform another LDD treatment to help you see your best at all distances far/mid and near.  Once you like your vision, we then б░lock-inб▒ the setting of the LALбпs and your vision is then permanent and you can discontinue use of these UV blocking glasses 24 hours after your final lock-in treatment from the LDD.

Patients with the LAL generally will have one eye set to see better far and mid-range and the other eye slightly offset to see better mid-range and near.  The target refraction is generally plano for the dominant eye and between -0.75 and -1.00 for the non-dominant eye.  This difference between the eyes is significantly less than б░monovisionб▒ where the eyes are different by between 1.5 and 2.0 diopters.  The difference between the two eyes with the LAL is referred to as б░blended visionб▒ which is very well tolerated and performs better than monovision.

So, for patients that want full range of focus and minimal night halo, the LAL works great.  For patients that have had success with monovision with contact lenses, the б░blended visionб▒ with the LAL works even better than monovision.

When we started using the light adjustable lens in August 2023, we were relying on the information about how the lens performed through word of mouth experience from other ophthalmologists and the RX sight team (the company that manufactures the light adjustable lens).

Thus far, the LAL appears to perform as predicted enabling patients to see far/mid and near with minimal to no reliance on glasses and with excellent night vision without significant halos.

In this video, we follow a patient who initially received the panoptix lens, and though he saw perfectly on-paper, he was dissatisfied with his subjective vision.

VwklHZFJ02Q,lens;phaco;cataract;lensectomy;,"Cataract/Lens Replacement Surgery to both eyes on the same day - How and why? Shannon Wong,MD","If you are having elective eye surgery such as premium cataract or premium lens replacement surgery that is not paid for by your insurance company then you have a choice to have one eye treated one day and the other eye treated on a different day OR you can choose to have surgery to both eyes on the same day.

In 2023, we started performing same day bilateral premium lens replacement surgery in our ambulatory surgical center here in Austin.  (Our ASC is fully accredited by medicare, the state of Texas health and human services commission and AAAHC).

For what circumstances do we perform same day bilateral (simultaneous bilateral) premium lens replacement?
1 To reduce patient anxiety.  Letбпs face it, if you are having surgery, do you want to go through the surgery process twice on two different days or would you rather go through the surgical process once in a single day?  Patients choosing same day bilateral surgery just want to have a one and done type of experience.
2 Patient convenience:  If we perform surgery to one eye, then have that patient return for a follow-up visit or two before performing surgery on the second eye, then perform additional follow-up visits for the second eye, then we are asking the patient to make twice the number of visits to our offices than we would if we simply did surgery to both eyes on the same day.  Same day bilateral surgery patients get back to a normal routine sooner and have to take less time off from work than patients who have separate eyes done on separate days. 
3 Patients that are very dependent on glasses or contacts to see.  If a patient requires a high or strong prescription to see and we bring one eye into focus, then their visual experience will be imbalanced in the time period between surgeries if performed on different days.  Same day bilateral surgical patients can get back to a normal schedule of activities sooner because their vision will be more balanced and their eyes will work together within one day.
4 Elective surgery only. For patients using their medical insurance or medicare, we only do surgery to one eye on one day and for insurance reimbursement reasons do not offer same day bilateral surgery.

In this video, weбпll show you our process for a patient undergoing same day bilateral premium lens replacement.

KavMihSTVEM,lens;,Blurred vision after lens replacement.  Scratched Vivity after YAG capsulotomy. PanOptix exchange.,"This patient had premium lens replacement with the Vivity lens and did not see well with the Vivity.  Despite YAG capsulotomy the patient did not see well with the Vivity lens and came to see us for a second opinion.

Our exam reveals anterior and poster Vivity lens scratch or scuff marks in the visual axis that accounted for his blurred vision with the Vivity lens.  

The patient wanted expanded range of vision greater than the range of vision that he was experiencing with the Vivity lens.  We chose to perform intraocular lens exchange - remove his Vivity lens (post YAG capsulotomy) in the absence of a posterior capsule then insert a panoptix lens in a reverse optic capture configuration.

Shannon Wong, MD.","The ClearView 3 Multifocal lens implant is a lens implant that enables patients to see far, mid and near without glasses and while providing great vision at night with minimal halos around lights at night.

We present our first case using the ClearView 3 multifocal lens implant in a patient who was seeing great with his PanOptix lens implants but was bothered by halos around lights at night seen with the panoptix lenses.

We performed intraocular lens exchange - removed his panoptix lens from his right eye - and placed a Clearview 3 multifocal lens into his right eye.

One day after surgery, his far/mid and near vision were comparable to the range of vision with the panoptix.  Importantly he did not perceive halos around lights through the Clearview 3 lens implant.

zQQaOfDbw1w,lens;capsular;,"Subluxed Multifocal Lens Implant - The Choices We Make Define Who We Are.  Shannon Wong, MD","We all have choices in life.  One dilemma we all face daily is when we want to do something that we are not supposed to do, how we find a way keep ourselves from doing it.  Another similar dilemma is when we see something that we don't want to do but we know we are supposed to do it, how do we find a way to make ourselves do it anyway.

When confronted with difficult surgical problems in ophthalmology, it is easier to choose the least stressful path.  We may even rationalize that we are acting in the best interests of the patient by not offering a service that may be complex or challenging.

There is a saying that I am reminded of, ""There is no growth in the comfort zone.""

In order to realize our greatest potential, we have to push ourselves to take on and endure difficult challenges and overcome them.  Through the process of great effort, we emerge stronger and better in most ways imaginable.  Similarly, by taking the easier path and staying in our own comfort zones we resign ourselves and those around us to remain average.

We present a challenging case involving a patient who has a subluxed synergy multifocal lens. The original surgeons recommended removing the multifocal lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.  Although intraocular lens exchange and replacement with a monofocal lens is easier from a technical perspective than repositioning the patient's existing multifocal lens, the patient wanted to maintain the full-range of focus that he could achieve only with a multifocal lens.

Therefore he traveled to see us for repositioning of his synergy lens implant.  We used 2 Ahmed capsular tension segments and a capsular tension ring fixated to the sclera with Goretex sutures to reposition and center this patient's synergy lens.

The patient had a great outcome.

Laser lens replacement (commonly referred to as refractive lens exchange) is an excellent solution for individuals 45 years and older who have noticed that they can no longer refocus from far to near like they used to.  Presbyopia is the name of the condition that affects 100% of the population by age 50.  Presbyopia causes us to lose our ability to refocus our eyes and is an inevitable part of the aging process.  The vast majority of the population is unaware that lens replacement surgery is a very successful, common and safe treatment for presbyopia.  Laser lens replacement will enable individuals to see far, mid and near with minimal use of glasses.  The long-term stability of this procedure is proven.  Furthermore after having laser lens replacement, the individual with the lens implant will never need cataract surgery in the future.  Laser lens replacement is identical to laser cataract surgery but performed for younger patients usually between the ages of 45-65 who have not yet developed visually significant cataracts.

In this video, we show the Joe Rogan podcast #1411 launched on 1/15/2020 where he interviews Robert Downey, Jr.  They discuss how they can no longer read without reading glasses and commiserate about how there is no solution to restore their ability to see up-close.

We try to perfect our lives, prevent problems, be perfectionistic, be proactive.
One of my favorite sayings is б░Prior prevention prevents poor performance.б▒
I have found that practicing all of these principles will help people to succeed.
But at the same time, stuff happensбнlife happens.
Things donбпt always work-out as we plan them.
This case is a perfect illustration of how life happens.
This patient is undergoing laser cataract surgery  with planned placement of a panoptix lens implant.
His pre-operative measurements:
UCVA 20/200 J32
The capsulorhexis was created with the femtosecond laser
The  cataract was removed safely.
Removal of cortex via irrigation and aspiration was routine.
Here we are at 5 minutes into the surgery.
We place the panoptix lens into the capsular bag.
The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.
The panoptix lens was perfectly centered at the end of the case as we can see the reflection of the Lumera microscrope lights centered on the central optic of the panoptix lens at the end of the procedure.
The next day, the patient comes-in for their follow-up visit.
The eye looks perfect thankfully.  The panoptix is perfectly centered.
The patientбпs vision is UCVA 20/20 J1+.  Refraction is -0.25 sphere.  IOP is 12 mm Hg.
So, sometimes life happensбнthings donбпt go as planned.  
It is how we respond to these daily situations that will define victory or defeat.
On a daily basis, we have to stand-by to get some.  Life happens.

BjHHuzK5fuU,lens;cataract;iol;capsular;,"Why do I see a shadow, crescent or arc after cataract surgery? Treatment of Negative Dysphotopsia.","Why do I see a shadow to the side of my vision after cataract surgery?

In our practice, we inform 100% of our patients that undergo cataract surgery that they will experience 4 common symptoms on the first day after their surgery:
1 slightly blurred vision
2 a scratchy sensation like an eyelash is rubbing their eye
3 a flicker or quiver to their vision
4 a dark shadow out to the side.

This last symptom is also known as б░Negative Dysphotopsia.б▒

Patients with negative dysphotopsia classically share the following history:
б░I see a dark shadow or arc out to the side.  It is curved like a semi-circle or crescent shape.  And when I place my hand like this (out to the side), the shadow goes away.б▒

The typical evolution of the negative dysphotopsia is that it goes away within 1-2 months as the eye heals and the brain adapts to seeing through the new lens implant.

Rarely, however some patients will have a persistent crescent or shadow that does not fully resolve and may persist indefinitely.  Most of these patients however state that the shadow is so subtle that it does not bother them or affect their quality of life.

For less than one-half of one percent of patients иC probably closer to one in 5000 patients иC they are severely bothered by the negative dysphotopsia that persists and does not go away.

What causes negative dysphotopsia?

First of all, ND typically occurs when the surgical procedure has been performed normally and the surgical result is normal without any complications whatsoever.

Some patients may ask, did something go wrong?  The answer is б░your surgery was routine and you are experiencing a normal unavoidable side effect that should go away with timeбнusually within one or two months.б▒

There are Two factors associated with ND:
1 The design of the edge of the intraocular lens иC show the edge of the IOL
2 The space between the lens and the iris иC show a graphic

The best treatment is prevention.  We have found that the lens that creates this side effect the least often in my experience is the Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lens. This is our standard basic monofocal lens used in basic cataract surgery in our practice.  It is a 3 piece lens that due to itбпs design simply does not cause much negative dysphotopsia.

To date, I have placed over 5000 Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lenses and have had 1 or 2 patients state that they have persistent negative dysphotopsia.  Neither of these patients required additional treatment of their ND because their symptoms were relatively mild and tolerable.

Now, the most commonly used lens type used by most ophthalmologists is the б░Single piece acrylic (SPA) lens.б▒

This lens design is used in the vast majority of basic, astigmatism-correcting or toric lenses, and premium presbyopia-correcting lenses.

So all of our patients who receive a premium presbyopia-correcting lens or an astigmatism-correcting lens in our practice will receive a single-piece acrylic lens.

This lens design in my experience is associated with a higher rate of negative dysphotopsia than the LI61AO.

Letбпs talk about the worst case scenario: The patient has negative dysphotopsia, is very bothered by it, and the symptom иC crescent/arc/shadow иC is present all the time and is not getting better after waiting 3 months or more.

Then there are in my opinion 3 options:
1 If the patient has a SPA, then remove the SPA and replace it with an LI61AO lens.  In my experience, that treatment works almost every time.
2 If the patient has a lens inside the bag, then we can place a lens between the bag and the iris into the ciliary sulcus иC moving it closer to the front of the eye and decreasing the space between the lens and the iris.
3 What if the patient however has a premium single piece acrylic IOL that is correcting both presbyopia and astigmatism and is only designed to be placed in the capsular bag?
a. Piggyback IOL in the sulcus
b. Reverse optic capture.

So let me present this case to you of a patient who had persistent very bothersome negative dysphotopsia.

This is a 49 year old gentleman who had lens replacement surgery on 11/11/19 with a panoptix toric lens.  
His UCVA and MR on 11/2/19 were: 
20/40 J16
MR: -0.25+2.00x105 20/20
The original surgery was routine and uncomplicated. 4 months postoperatively he reported the classic symptoms of ND including that he could б░constantly see the edge of the lens.б▒  He was very bothered.  So we performed Reverse optic capture on 4/29/2020.

His UCVA and refraction on the day of his IOL reposition:
UCVA 20/30 J2
MR: -0.25+1.00x115

The patient on POD1 was amazed with his vision.  The ND and edge of the lens effect were completely gone and his vision was improved as well.

UCVA 20/20 J1+
MR: -0.25+0.75x115 20/20

This case illustrates the technique to perform reverse optic capture for treatment of negative dysphotopsia in a patient with a panoptix toric lens.

Individuals who receive the ICL (also known as the Evo ICL) to correct extreme nearsightedness or myopia will eventually need to have their ICLбпs removed when they undergo cataract surgery.

This patient received the ICL 7 years ago in 2016.  He developed a cataract after undergoing vitrectomy surgery to treat a retina detachment.

He was a -13.0 D myope with a 30.0 mm axial length prior to receiving the ICL

To remove the ICL we fill the eye with anesthetic and viscoelastic, then use a sinskey hook to push the ICL footplates out of the ciliary sulcus.

Then using microforceps and a 0.12 forcep with teeth we gently remove the ICL by applying traction in a hand-over-hand technique to explant the ICL.

In this case, the ICL was removed in one piece.

We then remove this patientбпs cataract in a normal manner.

Using utrata forceps we create a 5.0 mm capsulorhexis, then remove the cataract safely.

After the cortex is removed we gently polish the posterior capsule to remove any residual lens cells.

Viscoelastic is used to expand the capsular bag and to viscodilate the pupil.

A capsule polisher is used to remove lens cells from the posterior surface of the anterior capsule.

Our panoptix lens is then inserted into the capsular bag.  Viscoelastic is removed from in front of and behind the implant while the implant is also rotated into correct alignment as this is a toric panoptix lens.

Once the lens is properly aligned and viscoelastic has been removed from behind the IOL, we use healon GV to fill the anterior chamber.

Because this is a 30.0 mm axial length eye, the preoperative biometry calls for a +4.0 D panoptix.  Since the lowest power panoptix is a +6.0, we insert a -2.0 D lens into the ciliary sulcus in a piggyback configuration to bring this patient to emmetropia.

We use viscoelastic to viscodilate the pupil to facilitate placement of the haptics into the sulcus.

We then remove all viscoelastic from between the two lens implants and the anterior chamber.

Finally we hydrate our corneal incisions to make sure they are self sealing.

This patient could see normally the following day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We can see the 1.36 mm pinhole aperture opening in the middle of the lens which is 6.0 mm in diameter.

The outer diameter of the black filtering ring is 3.23 mm.

Zooming in on the filtering ring which is embedded within the clear acrylic material of the lens, we see that the ring has a slightly porous consistency with thousands of tiny holes within the ring.

We have the patient look directly at the lights of our zeiss Lumera T microscope to confirm that the lens is centered properly.

When we started using the light adjustable lens in August 2023, we were relying on the information about how the lens performed through word of mouth experience from other ophthalmologists and the RX sight team (the company that manufactures the light adjustable lens).

Thus far, the LAL appears to perform as predicted enabling patients to see far/mid and near with minimal to no reliance on glasses and with excellent night vision without significant halos.

In this video, we follow a patient who initially received the panoptix lens, and though he saw perfectly on-paper, he was dissatisfied with his subjective vision.  

We chose to remove and replace this panoptix lens implant with the light adjustable lens through intraocular lens exchange.  Our patient shares his experience through the 2 months that it took to complete the LAL treatment process.

VwklHZFJ02Q,lens;phaco;cataract;lensectomy;,"Cataract/Lens Replacement Surgery to both eyes on the same day - How and why? Shannon Wong,MD","If you are having elective eye surgery such as premium cataract or premium lens replacement surgery that is not paid for by your insurance company then you have a choice to have one eye treated one day and the other eye treated on a different day OR you can choose to have surgery to both eyes on the same day.

In 2023, we started performing same day bilateral premium lens replacement surgery in our ambulatory surgical center here in Austin.  (Our ASC is fully accredited by medicare, the state of Texas health and human services commission and AAAHC).

For what circumstances do we perform same day bilateral (simultaneous bilateral) premium lens replacement?
1 To reduce patient anxiety.  Letбпs face it, if you are having surgery, do you want to go through the surgery process twice on two different days or would you rather go through the surgical process once in a single day?  Patients choosing same day bilateral surgery just want to have a one and done type of experience.
2 Patient convenience:  If we perform surgery to one eye, then have that patient return for a follow-up visit or two before performing surgery on the second eye, then perform additional follow-up visits for the second eye, then we are asking the patient to make twice the number of visits to our offices than we would if we simply did surgery to both eyes on the same day.  Same day bilateral surgery patients get back to a normal routine sooner and have to take less time off from work than patients who have separate eyes done on separate days. 
3 Patients that are very dependent on glasses or contacts to see.  If a patient requires a high or strong prescription to see and we bring one eye into focus, then their visual experience will be imbalanced in the time period between surgeries if performed on different days.  Same day bilateral surgical patients can get back to a normal schedule of activities sooner because their vision will be more balanced and their eyes will work together within one day.
4 Elective surgery only. For patients using their medical insurance or medicare, we only do surgery to one eye on one day and for insurance reimbursement reasons do not offer same day bilateral surgery.

In this video, weбпll show you our process for a patient undergoing same day bilateral premium lens replacement.

We performed intraocular lens exchange - removed his panoptix lens from his right eye - and placed a Clearview 3 multifocal lens into his right eye.

One day after surgery, his far/mid and near vision were comparable to the range of vision with the panoptix.  Importantly he did not perceive halos around lights through the Clearview 3 lens implant.

Thank you to our patient for allowing us to share his experience.

We try to perfect our lives, prevent problems, be perfectionistic, be proactive.
One of my favorite sayings is б░Prior prevention prevents poor performance.б▒
I have found that practicing all of these principles will help people to succeed.
But at the same time, stuff happensбнlife happens.
Things donбпt always work-out as we plan them.
This case is a perfect illustration of how life happens.
This patient is undergoing laser cataract surgery  with planned placement of a panoptix lens implant.
His pre-operative measurements:
UCVA 20/200 J32
The capsulorhexis was created with the femtosecond laser
The  cataract was removed safely.
Removal of cortex via irrigation and aspiration was routine.
Here we are at 5 minutes into the surgery.
We place the panoptix lens into the capsular bag.
The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.
The panoptix lens was perfectly centered at the end of the case as we can see the reflection of the Lumera microscrope lights centered on the central optic of the panoptix lens at the end of the procedure.
The next day, the patient comes-in for their follow-up visit.
The eye looks perfect thankfully.  The panoptix is perfectly centered.
The patientбпs vision is UCVA 20/20 J1+.  Refraction is -0.25 sphere.  IOP is 12 mm Hg.
So, sometimes life happensбнthings donбпt go as planned.  
It is how we respond to these daily situations that will define victory or defeat.
On a daily basis, we have to stand-by to get some.  Life happens.

LLz_NYddlLg,lens;cataract;capsular;,Is Cataract Surgery Boring? Panoptix with an open posterior capsule. Posterior capsulorhexis.,"Is cataract surgery boring?

After all, we are just removing and replacing the natural lens with a lens implantбн.and we do it over and over thousands of times during the career of an ophthalmologist.

The short answer in my experience is, б░No.  It never gets boring.б▒

Why?

Because if you really care about doing great work, then there is a drive for perfection.  With cataract surgery, the goals are actually very diverse and involve a varied skill set.  For each surgical procedure we have to answer many questions:
1 Can I achieve as perfect an outcome as possible using techniques and tricks that I have acquired and learned over my lifetime?
2 Can I finish this task as efficiently as possible with the least amount of wasted time, materials and complete it with optimal safety?
3 How can I perform this task better now than I have in the past?
4 When unusual situations arise, can I problem solve to finish the mission safely?
5 When we encounter stressful situations, can I control my emotions to complete the mission while managing my surgical team and making sure the patient experience is smooth?

Itбпs easy to think.  This procedure is so routine that it must get repetitive and redundant and boring.

If it getбпs boring, then the operator has plateaued in their skills and has reached a period of complacency and stagnation.

If surgery was repetitive and redundant, then robots could perform surgery.

They canбпt.

Why?  Because despite perfect planning and preparation, Murphy always shows-up.

This case illustrates that concept.

This is a 64 year old patient who is having Laser Lens Replacement with the panoptix toric lens to correct his presbyopia and astigmatism and to enable him to see far, mid and near without glasses.

His preoperative vision without glasses:
20/30 far and J5 (or 20/40 near)

His refraction:
+0.50+2.00x180 20/20

This is the appearance of the eye on POD 1.

His postoperative vision without glasses:
20/25 far and J1 (or 20/25 near)

His refraction:
Plano

Most importantly, he is happy with his vision without glasses and can now read comfortably without glasses from his eye with the panoptix lens.  Based on his positive experience and improved vision, he now chooses to have his second eye corrected one week later with the same type of lens implant.

So, cataract surgery never seems boring.  It is a constant challenge to master the technical, emotional and human skills that will create the safest, most efficient and best visual outcome that will ultimately make the patient happy so they can experience the rest of their lives with the best vision possible.

But it is the mindset that makes it challenging and interesting.  From my perspective, each surgical case is an opportunity to:
1 improve someoneбпs life by improving their visionбнat itбпs core иC helping people
2 improve the team working with me by sharing knowledge 
3 improve myself by challenging myself to perfect the array of skills necessary to create the best experience for the patient and the team

There are so many variables that we have to manage during cataract surgery. One of these variables involves taking risks.  Everything in life including surgery has risks.  But in order to achieve the greatest rewards in life, you have to take risks.  And by taking risks, we ultimately learn to solve problems that make us better surgeons and allow us to deliver the best possible care for our patients.",panoptix posterior capsule tear,single piece acrylic lens in capsular bad with posterior capsule break or tear,posterior capsulorhexis,little maneuver,capsulorhexis rescue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Symfony lens is a presbyopia-correcting lens implant that successfully corrects vision at all distances - far, mid and near - enabling patients to see with minimal to no reliance on glasses.

It works well in 99+% of patients in our experience thus far.  Since no lens implant is perfect and without side effects, there are patients who may not like the quality or quantity of vision with the Symfony.

We present a case of lens exchange (IOL exchange) where we removed the symfony lens and replaced it with a panoptix lens after the patient had undergone prior YAG laser capsulotomy.  The patient did not like the vision with the Symfony but was satisfied with the vision of the PanOptix lens.  She preferred the range of focus with the PanOptix lens more than the Symfony lens.

Well, everyone moves during surgery.  

What do we normally do to compensate for patient movement?

1 We give generous amounts of anesthetic on the eye and inside the eye to make our patients comfortable.  
2 Patients receive a valium tablet that helps them relax. 
3  We ask our patients to look directly at the light in front of them to help them fixate on a target.
4 I rest my hands on the patientбпs head so when they move, my hands move in sync with their head
5 And finally our surgical instruments help mitigate eye movement during surgery.

In this procedure we demonstrate the following surgical techniques:
1 one handed phacoemulsification
2 suture fixation of the eye/globe during cataract surgery
3 Inamura pre chopper
4 viscodilation of the pupil for irrigation and aspiration.

mjuxZb1tLpE,lens;,When the haptic sticks to the optic with Alcon Clareon lenses (PanOptix) иC My solution.,"For ophthalmologists that use the Alcon clareon lenses, a common issue or inconvenience is that the lens haptic often sticks to the lens optic after the lens has been inserted into the eye.

Iбпve tried various ways to remedy this problem иC using various instruments to push or pull the haptic away from the optic.

Ultimately, the solution is the indirect approach.  Using balanced salt solution on a 3 ml syringe with a 27 ga cannula, I simply inject BSS aimed at the point where the haptic is stuck to the optic.  Usually within about 5 seconds, the haptic will separate from the optic.

Here is a second case using the same technique.  Since most surgeons already have BSS in a syringe and a 27 ga cannula, this step is simple and easy to perform and solve this minor inconvenience.

yyBlA3a9xLQ,lens;cataract;capsular;,How I polish the posterior capsule during cataract and lens replacement surgery - The Capsule Guard.,"For each cataract or lens replacement surgery, we remove the cortex then are left with these small cortical fibers that are adherent to the posterior capsule.

Over the past year, we have been using the capsule guard which is a single-use irrigation and aspiration instrument as our go-to device.  The capsule guard is the most capsule-friendly I/A device that I have used in my career.

To polish the posterior capsule, I directly aspirate the posterior capsular fibers under low vacuum.  I am careful to only move the aspiration tip and aspirate the posterior capsule moving in a linear or curvilinear motion from bottom to top or side-to-side.  I do not aspirate moving from top to bottom or aspirate in two directions in order to avoid inadvertently tearing the posterior capsule.

Using this instrument with this technique has proven to be extremely safe and effective for creating the clearest posterior capsules possible during cataract and lens replacement surgery.

Zooming in on the filtering ring which is embedded within the clear acrylic material of the lens, we see that the ring has a slightly porous consistency with thousands of tiny holes within the ring.

Individuals who receive the ICL (also known as the Evo ICL) to correct extreme nearsightedness or myopia will eventually need to have their ICLбпs removed when they undergo cataract surgery.

This patient received the ICL 7 years ago in 2016.  He developed a cataract after undergoing vitrectomy surgery to treat a retina detachment.

He was a -13.0 D myope with a 30.0 mm axial length prior to receiving the ICL

To remove the ICL we fill the eye with anesthetic and viscoelastic, then use a sinskey hook to push the ICL footplates out of the ciliary sulcus.

Then using microforceps and a 0.12 forcep with teeth we gently remove the ICL by applying traction in a hand-over-hand technique to explant the ICL.

In this case, the ICL was removed in one piece.

We then remove this patientбпs cataract in a normal manner.

Using utrata forceps we create a 5.0 mm capsulorhexis, then remove the cataract safely.

After the cortex is removed we gently polish the posterior capsule to remove any residual lens cells.

Viscoelastic is used to expand the capsular bag and to viscodilate the pupil.

A capsule polisher is used to remove lens cells from the posterior surface of the anterior capsule.

Our panoptix lens is then inserted into the capsular bag.  Viscoelastic is removed from in front of and behind the implant while the implant is also rotated into correct alignment as this is a toric panoptix lens.

Once the lens is properly aligned and viscoelastic has been removed from behind the IOL, we use healon GV to fill the anterior chamber.

Because this is a 30.0 mm axial length eye, the preoperative biometry calls for a +4.0 D panoptix.  Since the lowest power panoptix is a +6.0, we insert a -2.0 D lens into the ciliary sulcus in a piggyback configuration to bring this patient to emmetropia.

We use viscoelastic to viscodilate the pupil to facilitate placement of the haptics into the sulcus.

We then remove all viscoelastic from between the two lens implants and the anterior chamber.

Finally we hydrate our corneal incisions to make sure they are self sealing.

This patient could see normally the following day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optics are spectacular.

There is on occasion an issue where the haptics might be bent during insertion of the lens.

When this situation happens, here is how I typically fix this situation.

In this case, the leading haptic is trapped between the optic and the injector causing the leading haptic to be bent.

If we place the lens into the capsular bag with a bent haptic, the lens will be decentered.

Because the LI61AO is an aspheric lens, small amounts of lens decentration are inconsequential.

But we still want the lens to be as centered as possible.

So we use our lens chopper to rotate the IOL to bring the bent haptic close to the primary incision, then tease the haptic out of the eye.

Then using two forceps, we bend the haptic back into the normal conformation.

Once the haptic shape is normalized, then we place the IOL and haptics back into the capsular bag.

During irrigation and aspiration we confirm that the IOL is well centered.

Iбпve performed this maneuver hundreds of times over the past decade and have not noticed any long-term issues with these patients.  The lens seems to stay very well centered long-term.

I hope this video helps give you a solution if you encounter this situation during cataract surgery.

From June-November 2021, I placed 400 Synergy lens implants for patients seeking premium cataract surgery and premium lens replacement.  The vast majority of patients with the synergy lens see quite well.  

A significant percentage of patients with the synergy lens will however not  see as well as they want - particularly with vision far away - to a degree that they find their vision unacceptable.  If a patient with the synergy lens finds their vision unacceptable, then sometimes the best remedy is the perform intraocular lens exchange to remove the synergy and replace it with an alternative lens implant such as the panoptix, vivity or a monofocal lens implant.

In this video, we share a patient's perspective with her vision with bilateral synergy lenses and then her vision after intraocular lens exchange where we removed her synergy lenses and replaced them with bilateral panoptix lens implants.

LLz_NYddlLg,lens;cataract;capsular;,Is Cataract Surgery Boring? Panoptix with an open posterior capsule. Posterior capsulorhexis.,"Is cataract surgery boring?

After all, we are just removing and replacing the natural lens with a lens implantбн.and we do it over and over thousands of times during the career of an ophthalmologist.

The short answer in my experience is, б░No.  It never gets boring.б▒

Why?

Because if you really care about doing great work, then there is a drive for perfection.  With cataract surgery, the goals are actually very diverse and involve a varied skill set.  For each surgical procedure we have to answer many questions:
1 Can I achieve as perfect an outcome as possible using techniques and tricks that I have acquired and learned over my lifetime?
2 Can I finish this task as efficiently as possible with the least amount of wasted time, materials and complete it with optimal safety?
3 How can I perform this task better now than I have in the past?
4 When unusual situations arise, can I problem solve to finish the mission safely?
5 When we encounter stressful situations, can I control my emotions to complete the mission while managing my surgical team and making sure the patient experience is smooth?

Itбпs easy to think.  This procedure is so routine that it must get repetitive and redundant and boring.

If it getбпs boring, then the operator has plateaued in their skills and has reached a period of complacency and stagnation.

If surgery was repetitive and redundant, then robots could perform surgery.

They canбпt.

Why?  Because despite perfect planning and preparation, Murphy always shows-up.

This case illustrates that concept.

This is a 64 year old patient who is having Laser Lens Replacement with the panoptix toric lens to correct his presbyopia and astigmatism and to enable him to see far, mid and near without glasses.

His preoperative vision without glasses:
20/30 far and J5 (or 20/40 near)

His refraction:
+0.50+2.00x180 20/20

This is the appearance of the eye on POD 1.

His postoperative vision without glasses:
20/25 far and J1 (or 20/25 near)

His refraction:
Plano

Most importantly, he is happy with his vision without glasses and can now read comfortably without glasses from his eye with the panoptix lens.  Based on his positive experience and improved vision, he now chooses to have his second eye corrected one week later with the same type of lens implant.

So, cataract surgery never seems boring.  It is a constant challenge to master the technical, emotional and human skills that will create the safest, most efficient and best visual outcome that will ultimately make the patient happy so they can experience the rest of their lives with the best vision possible.

But it is the mindset that makes it challenging and interesting.  From my perspective, each surgical case is an opportunity to:
1 improve someoneбпs life by improving their visionбнat itбпs core иC helping people
2 improve the team working with me by sharing knowledge 
3 improve myself by challenging myself to perfect the array of skills necessary to create the best experience for the patient and the team

There are so many variables that we have to manage during cataract surgery. One of these variables involves taking risks.  Everything in life including surgery has risks.  But in order to achieve the greatest rewards in life, you have to take risks.  And by taking risks, we ultimately learn to solve problems that make us better surgeons and allow us to deliver the best possible care for our patients.",panoptix posterior capsule tear,single piece acrylic lens in capsular bad with posterior capsule break or tear,posterior capsulorhexis,little maneuver,capsulorhexis rescue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BjHHuzK5fuU,lens;cataract;iol;capsular;,"Why do I see a shadow, crescent or arc after cataract surgery? Treatment of Negative Dysphotopsia.","Why do I see a shadow to the side of my vision after cataract surgery?

In our practice, we inform 100% of our patients that undergo cataract surgery that they will experience 4 common symptoms on the first day after their surgery:
1 slightly blurred vision
2 a scratchy sensation like an eyelash is rubbing their eye
3 a flicker or quiver to their vision
4 a dark shadow out to the side.

This last symptom is also known as б░Negative Dysphotopsia.б▒

Patients with negative dysphotopsia classically share the following history:
б░I see a dark shadow or arc out to the side.  It is curved like a semi-circle or crescent shape.  And when I place my hand like this (out to the side), the shadow goes away.б▒

The typical evolution of the negative dysphotopsia is that it goes away within 1-2 months as the eye heals and the brain adapts to seeing through the new lens implant.

Rarely, however some patients will have a persistent crescent or shadow that does not fully resolve and may persist indefinitely.  Most of these patients however state that the shadow is so subtle that it does not bother them or affect their quality of life.

For less than one-half of one percent of patients иC probably closer to one in 5000 patients иC they are severely bothered by the negative dysphotopsia that persists and does not go away.

What causes negative dysphotopsia?

First of all, ND typically occurs when the surgical procedure has been performed normally and the surgical result is normal without any complications whatsoever.

Some patients may ask, did something go wrong?  The answer is б░your surgery was routine and you are experiencing a normal unavoidable side effect that should go away with timeбнusually within one or two months.б▒

There are Two factors associated with ND:
1 The design of the edge of the intraocular lens иC show the edge of the IOL
2 The space between the lens and the iris иC show a graphic

The best treatment is prevention.  We have found that the lens that creates this side effect the least often in my experience is the Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lens. This is our standard basic monofocal lens used in basic cataract surgery in our practice.  It is a 3 piece lens that due to itбпs design simply does not cause much negative dysphotopsia.

To date, I have placed over 5000 Bausch and Lomb LI61AO lenses and have had 1 or 2 patients state that they have persistent negative dysphotopsia.  Neither of these patients required additional treatment of their ND because their symptoms were relatively mild and tolerable.

Now, the most commonly used lens type used by most ophthalmologists is the б░Single piece acrylic (SPA) lens.б▒

This lens design is used in the vast majority of basic, astigmatism-correcting or toric lenses, and premium presbyopia-correcting lenses.

So all of our patients who receive a premium presbyopia-correcting lens or an astigmatism-correcting lens in our practice will receive a single-piece acrylic lens.

This lens design in my experience is associated with a higher rate of negative dysphotopsia than the LI61AO.

Letбпs talk about the worst case scenario: The patient has negative dysphotopsia, is very bothered by it, and the symptom иC crescent/arc/shadow иC is present all the time and is not getting better after waiting 3 months or more.

Then there are in my opinion 3 options:
1 If the patient has a SPA, then remove the SPA and replace it with an LI61AO lens.  In my experience, that treatment works almost every time.
2 If the patient has a lens inside the bag, then we can place a lens between the bag and the iris into the ciliary sulcus иC moving it closer to the front of the eye and decreasing the space between the lens and the iris.
3 What if the patient however has a premium single piece acrylic IOL that is correcting both presbyopia and astigmatism and is only designed to be placed in the capsular bag?
a. Piggyback IOL in the sulcus
b. Reverse optic capture.

So let me present this case to you of a patient who had persistent very bothersome negative dysphotopsia.

This is a 49 year old gentleman who had lens replacement surgery on 11/11/19 with a panoptix toric lens.  
His UCVA and MR on 11/2/19 were: 
20/40 J16
MR: -0.25+2.00x105 20/20
The original surgery was routine and uncomplicated. 4 months postoperatively he reported the classic symptoms of ND including that he could б░constantly see the edge of the lens.б▒  He was very bothered.  So we performed Reverse optic capture on 4/29/2020.

His UCVA and refraction on the day of his IOL reposition:
UCVA 20/30 J2
MR: -0.25+1.00x115

The patient on POD1 was amazed with his vision.  The ND and edge of the lens effect were completely gone and his vision was improved as well.

UCVA 20/20 J1+
MR: -0.25+0.75x115 20/20

This case illustrates the technique to perform reverse optic capture for treatment of negative dysphotopsia in a patient with a panoptix toric lens.

5cca7rBIfcE,lens;cataract;capsular;,"Life Happens...Panoptix insertion with capsule break during surgery.  Shannon Wong, MD. 2-8-2020","Sometimesбн.in factбн.many timesбнlife just happens.
We try to perfect our lives, prevent problems, be perfectionistic, be proactive.
One of my favorite sayings is б░Prior prevention prevents poor performance.б▒
I have found that practicing all of these principles will help people to succeed.
But at the same time, stuff happensбнlife happens.
Things donбпt always work-out as we plan them.
This case is a perfect illustration of how life happens.
This patient is undergoing laser cataract surgery  with planned placement of a panoptix lens implant.
His pre-operative measurements:
UCVA 20/200 J32
The capsulorhexis was created with the femtosecond laser
The  cataract was removed safely.
Removal of cortex via irrigation and aspiration was routine.
Here we are at 5 minutes into the surgery.
We place the panoptix lens into the capsular bag.
The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.

o4l29kfM2CE,lens;cataract;,"Thoughts on robotic surgery. Can robots perform surgery? Shannon Wong, MD","Itбпs 2020, Tesla cars are attempting to enable fully autonomous drivingбнdriving via AI without humans , 5G high speed internet is emerging, and robots are becoming more and more evolved.

What if bots could do cataract surgery?  What AI would they need?  What are the myriad of decisions that would need to be considered in order to safely perform cataract surgery? 

As an eye surgeon, we perform a surgical procedure иC cataract or lens replacement surgery - that for most experienced surgeons takes 7-10 minutes to complete.  It is a routine, very safe procedure.  I often wonder as I am workingбнwill robots be able to replace me and do what I do one day in the future?  If so, when.  What would be needed to make cataract surgery fully autonomous by robots?

I think to myself, I have 25 years and 15,000 cataract procedures of experience inside my brain.  If other experts could share their experience and we could combine our collective experience and expertise from surgeons worldwide and apply it to a robot, then the robot would theoretically be able to perform surgery as well if not better than a human.

Itбпs like if you could combine the skills of Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Kobe Bryant into one robot, then that robot would have abilities above and beyond any one of the players individually.

In order for a bot to replace humans doing surgery, we would need a combination of:
1 Robotic hands that are more facile and dexterous than a human
2 An extremely powerful and fast computer using Artificial intelligence that could combine the experience and expertise of the best surgeons in the world and apply it to direct the robotic hands to complete the surgical steps
3 A camera system that has a FPS of at least 120 frames per second

If you have ever seen the terminator you may have seen the heads-up display that the terminator uses to show the analysis of information that the terminator (a cyborg) is receiving and analyzing in real-time.

So, in this video, I will show you my heads-up display and what I am thinking in my videoбн.like the heads-up display seen in the terminator.  Personally, I donбпt envision bots doing eye surgery in the next 20 years.  But I will show you the myriad of decisions that would need to be made by a bot doing surgery. 

Humans as of 2020 are more capable than machines at dynamic interaction to a constantly changing environment.  Surgery requires uniquely human emotional qualities combined with technical maneuvers to successfully and safely complete the procedure.

The risk of complications that will affect vision during surgery performed by humans is less than 1%.  Bots would have to prove to be better and safer and more cost efficient than humans in the future to supplant eye surgery performed by people on other people.

Do I think that robots will be doing surgery in the next 20 years?  Itбпs highly unlikely in my opinion.  The types of  adjustments that have to be made in real time are complex and random.

I do believe that autonomous driving will become a reality in the next 10 years and that AI and 5G will change our lives for the better.  But for the foreseeable future, I think your surgery will still be performed by humans, physicians and surgeons.",robotic surgery,bots performing surgery,robots in medicine,artificial intelligence in medicine,machines performing surgery,cataract surgery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lC9_NG0RJhA,lens;cataract;lens surgery;,Preparing for Cataract and Lens Surgery Instructions - What to Expect. 9-25-19.,"Shannon Wong, MD explains what all individuals undergoing laser lens replacement, laser cataract surgery and basic cataract surgery should know and plan for prior to having eye surgery.  In order to have the best surgical experience, there are certain key concepts that all patients should be aware of.

Rules for successful surgery:
1 Eat a light meal the day of surgery.
2 Please take all medications as usual, especially blood pressure medications, unless previously specified otherwise by your surgeon.
3 If you are on medications, please bring a list of medications with the name, dosage and how often you take it.
4 Please be prepared to make payment on the day of surgery. We accept MasterCard, Visa, Discover, AMEX, Care Credit, Cash or Check only.
бд         If you plan on paying for surgery with a credit or debit card, we encourage you to contact your bank to inform them of the upcoming charge to avoid any payment denials upon check-in for surgery. Failure to do so may result in delayed surgery or the need to reschedule.
бд         If you plan on paying with an FSA or HSA card, contact your HR department prior to surgery for clarification on how to correctly use your available funds. You may have a daily limit.
5 Plan to be at the surgery center approximately 2 hours.
6 You will not be able to drive home on the day of surgery. Arrangements must be made for someone to remain here on the premises while you are in surgery in case of an emergency.  Your ride needs to be here ready in the waiting room to drive you home at the end of surgery.  Please remind your ride to stay here at the building while you are in surgery. 
7 To ensure our surgery schedule runs smoothly, we require your driver to remain on Austin Eye premises for the duration of your surgical visit.
8 Dress warmly. We do not have you change clothes and the operating room is kept cold.
9 If you need to cancel or reschedule your surgery, we do ask for 72 hours notice. Failure to do so will result in a $100 charge.
10 If you wear a hearing aid, we will ask you to remove it from the side we will be operating on. You may wear dentures as usual.
11 You should not wear contact lenses to the surgery center.
12 We do have a secure holding area for your small personal items, but please do not bring jewelry or other valuables. We will not be held responsible for lost items.
13 Please bathe or shower the morning of surgery. Wash your face with soap and water only.
14 On the day of surgery, do not apply any creams, lotions, or moisturizers around your surgical eye.
15 Do not wear any makeup on the day of surgery and refrain from using eye make up on your surgical eye for 1 week after surgery.
16 Surgery will take place at the Jollyville Road location.
17 If this is your second eye surgery, you will need to bring sunglasses with you on the day of surgery (we will not provide a second pair of sunglasses).
18 You will need to purchase artificial tears before surgery to use after surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lens optic and haptics are inside the bag.
The capsular bag is perfect at this point.
We then proceed to remove the viscoelastic from in front of the panoptix lens.
We then rotate the lens about 20 degrees clockwise when out of nowhere we see an opening in the posterior capsule at one oбпclock.
The capsule opening is identified immediately.  Then I think to myself, б░How did that happen?б▒
I stop, assess the situation, then thinkбнif the capsule is open, then the panoptix lens will not likely remain centered over the long-term.
What do I do now?
Well, letбпs place some viscoelastic into the eye to assess the situation and get a better handle of what we  are dealing with.
I really canбпt see the leading haptic.  So we elect to place iris retractors  to visualize the leading haptic at 12 Oбпclock.
Now we can see the capsule is wide open at 12 Oбпclock.
In order to have the panoptix center, we need to rotate the haptics from 12 and 6 Oбпclock to the 3 and 9 Oбпclock orientation where there is equatorial capsular bag that would support and allow the panoptix to center.
So, we expand the capsular bag with healon pro viscoelastic and rotate the lens gently 3 clock hours clockwise.
We place additional incisions to allow us to place our instruments at the optimal approach angles to rotate the lens while maintaining a stable anterior chamber.
Once the lens looks to be in the correct position and orientation, we remove the iris retractors and burp out the healon pro viscoelastic.  We choose to not perform irrigation and aspiration of the viscoelastic which would create more turbulence in the eye which might also draw vitreous into the anterior chamber.
The healon pro viscoelastic comes-out easily with instillation of BSS through the side-port incisions.
If the lens did not center, my next move would have been to perform reverse optic capture to move the optic anterior to the anterior capsule leaflets while leaving the haptics in the capsular bag.
The panoptix lens was perfectly centered at the end of the case as we can see the reflection of the Lumera microscrope lights centered on the central optic of the panoptix lens at the end of the procedure.
The next day, the patient comes-in for their follow-up visit.
The eye looks perfect thankfully.  The panoptix is perfectly centered.
The patientбпs vision is UCVA 20/20 J1+.  Refraction is -0.25 sphere.  IOP is 12 mm Hg.
So, sometimes life happensбнthings donбпt go as planned.  
It is how we respond to these daily situations that will define victory or defeat.
On a daily basis, we have to stand-by to get some.  Life happens.
Thank you for watching.  Have a wonderful day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LLz_NYddlLg,lens;cataract;capsular;,Is Cataract Surgery Boring? Panoptix with an open posterior capsule. Posterior capsulorhexis.,"Is cataract surgery boring?

After all, we are just removing and replacing the natural lens with a lens implantбн.and we do it over and over thousands of times during the career of an ophthalmologist.

The short answer in my experience is, б░No.  It never gets boring.б▒

Why?

Because if you really care about doing great work, then there is a drive for perfection.  With cataract surgery, the goals are actually very diverse and involve a varied skill set.  For each surgical procedure we have to answer many questions:
1 Can I achieve as perfect an outcome as possible using techniques and tricks that I have acquired and learned over my lifetime?
2 Can I finish this task as efficiently as possible with the least amount of wasted time, materials and complete it with optimal safety?
3 How can I perform this task better now than I have in the past?
4 When unusual situations arise, can I problem solve to finish the mission safely?
5 When we encounter stressful situations, can I control my emotions to complete the mission while managing my surgical team and making sure the patient experience is smooth?

Itбпs easy to think.  This procedure is so routine that it must get repetitive and redundant and boring.

If it getбпs boring, then the operator has plateaued in their skills and has reached a period of complacency and stagnation.

If surgery was repetitive and redundant, then robots could perform surgery.

They canбпt.

Why?  Because despite perfect planning and preparation, Murphy always shows-up.

This case illustrates that concept.

This is a 64 year old patient who is having Laser Lens Replacement with the panoptix toric lens to correct his presbyopia and astigmatism and to enable him to see far, mid and near without glasses.

His preoperative vision without glasses:
20/30 far and J5 (or 20/40 near)

His refraction:
+0.50+2.00x180 20/20

This is the appearance of the eye on POD 1.

His postoperative vision without glasses:
20/25 far and J1 (or 20/25 near)

His refraction:
Plano

Most importantly, he is happy with his vision without glasses and can now read comfortably without glasses from his eye with the panoptix lens.  Based on his positive experience and improved vision, he now chooses to have his second eye corrected one week later with the same type of lens implant.

So, cataract surgery never seems boring.  It is a constant challenge to master the technical, emotional and human skills that will create the safest, most efficient and best visual outcome that will ultimately make the patient happy so they can experience the rest of their lives with the best vision possible.

But it is the mindset that makes it challenging and interesting.  From my perspective, each surgical case is an opportunity to:
1 improve someoneбпs life by improving their visionбнat itбпs core иC helping people
2 improve the team working with me by sharing knowledge 
3 improve myself by challenging myself to perfect the array of skills necessary to create the best experience for the patient and the team

There are so many variables that we have to manage during cataract surgery. One of these variables involves taking risks.  Everything in life including surgery has risks.  But in order to achieve the greatest rewards in life, you have to take risks.  And by taking risks, we ultimately learn to solve problems that make us better surgeons and allow us to deliver the best possible care for our patients.",panoptix posterior capsule tear,single piece acrylic lens in capsular bad with posterior capsule break or tear,posterior capsulorhexis,little maneuver,capsulorhexis rescue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no perfect lens implant.  How to manage the unhappy patient with a Synergy lens. https://youtu.be/pfrk6MHVQGU

From June-November 2021, I placed 400 Synergy lens implants for patients seeking premium cataract surgery and premium lens replacement.  The vast majority of patients with the synergy lens see quite well.  

A significant percentage of patients with the synergy lens will however not  see as well as they want - particularly with vision far away - to a degree that they find their vision unacceptable.  If a patient with the synergy lens finds their vision unacceptable, then sometimes the best remedy is the perform intraocular lens exchange to remove the synergy and replace it with an alternative lens implant such as the panoptix, vivity or a monofocal lens implant.

In this video, we share a patient's perspective with her vision with bilateral synergy lenses and then her vision after intraocular lens exchange where we removed her synergy lenses and replaced them with bilateral panoptix lens implants.

Individuals who receive the ICL (also known as the Evo ICL) to correct extreme nearsightedness or myopia will eventually need to have their ICLбпs removed when they undergo cataract surgery.

This patient received the ICL 7 years ago in 2016.  He developed a cataract after undergoing vitrectomy surgery to treat a retina detachment.

He was a -13.0 D myope with a 30.0 mm axial length prior to receiving the ICL

To remove the ICL we fill the eye with anesthetic and viscoelastic, then use a sinskey hook to push the ICL footplates out of the ciliary sulcus.

Then using microforceps and a 0.12 forcep with teeth we gently remove the ICL by applying traction in a hand-over-hand technique to explant the ICL.

In this case, the ICL was removed in one piece.

We then remove this patientбпs cataract in a normal manner.

Using utrata forceps we create a 5.0 mm capsulorhexis, then remove the cataract safely.

After the cortex is removed we gently polish the posterior capsule to remove any residual lens cells.

Viscoelastic is used to expand the capsular bag and to viscodilate the pupil.

A capsule polisher is used to remove lens cells from the posterior surface of the anterior capsule.

Our panoptix lens is then inserted into the capsular bag.  Viscoelastic is removed from in front of and behind the implant while the implant is also rotated into correct alignment as this is a toric panoptix lens.

Once the lens is properly aligned and viscoelastic has been removed from behind the IOL, we use healon GV to fill the anterior chamber.

Because this is a 30.0 mm axial length eye, the preoperative biometry calls for a +4.0 D panoptix.  Since the lowest power panoptix is a +6.0, we insert a -2.0 D lens into the ciliary sulcus in a piggyback configuration to bring this patient to emmetropia.

We use viscoelastic to viscodilate the pupil to facilitate placement of the haptics into the sulcus.

We then remove all viscoelastic from between the two lens implants and the anterior chamber.

Finally we hydrate our corneal incisions to make sure they are self sealing.

This patient could see normally the following day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zooming in on the filtering ring which is embedded within the clear acrylic material of the lens, we see that the ring has a slightly porous consistency with thousands of tiny holes within the ring.

We have the patient look directly at the lights of our zeiss Lumera T microscope to confirm that the lens is centered properly.

Over the past year, we have been using the capsule guard which is a single-use irrigation and aspiration instrument as our go-to device.  The capsule guard is the most capsule-friendly I/A device that I have used in my career.

To polish the posterior capsule, I directly aspirate the posterior capsular fibers under low vacuum.  I am careful to only move the aspiration tip and aspirate the posterior capsule moving in a linear or curvilinear motion from bottom to top or side-to-side.  I do not aspirate moving from top to bottom or aspirate in two directions in order to avoid inadvertently tearing the posterior capsule.

Using this instrument with this technique has proven to be extremely safe and effective for creating the clearest posterior capsules possible during cataract and lens replacement surgery.

Iбпve tried various ways to remedy this problem иC using various instruments to push or pull the haptic away from the optic.

Ultimately, the solution is the indirect approach.  Using balanced salt solution on a 3 ml syringe with a 27 ga cannula, I simply inject BSS aimed at the point where the haptic is stuck to the optic.  Usually within about 5 seconds, the haptic will separate from the optic.

Here is a second case using the same technique.  Since most surgeons already have BSS in a syringe and a 27 ga cannula, this step is simple and easy to perform and solve this minor inconvenience.

The light adjustable lens or б░LALб▒ enables patients to see far/mid and near with minimal halo effect at night when implanted into both eyes.

The LAL works well but involves more visits to our office than all of the other lens implants that we use.  

If you choose the LAL, immediately after surgery and for the first 3 weeks after surgery, you will see well far away but will need to use reading glasses.  Additionally during the first 2 months after surgery, you will be required to wear these UV blocking glasses during the daytime when outdoors.  They donбпt need to be worn indoors.

Starting 3 weeks after receiving the LAL, we use this Light delivery device to adjust and customize the focus of the LAL to improve the reading vision in one or both eyes.

So starting 3 weeks after receiving the LAL, in addition to seeing clearly far away without glasses you start seeing better close-up and at mid-range.  We adjust the focus, have you test drive your vision in the real world for one week, then if another treatment or two is needed adjust how you see, we perform another LDD treatment to help you see your best at all distances far/mid and near.  Once you like your vision, we then б░lock-inб▒ the setting of the LALбпs and your vision is then permanent and you can discontinue use of these UV blocking glasses 24 hours after your final lock-in treatment from the LDD.

Patients with the LAL generally will have one eye set to see better far and mid-range and the other eye slightly offset to see better mid-range and near.  The target refraction is generally plano for the dominant eye and between -0.75 and -1.00 for the non-dominant eye.  This difference between the eyes is significantly less than б░monovisionб▒ where the eyes are different by between 1.5 and 2.0 diopters.  The difference between the two eyes with the LAL is referred to as б░blended visionб▒ which is very well tolerated and performs better than monovision.

So, for patients that want full range of focus and minimal night halo, the LAL works great.  For patients that have had success with monovision with contact lenses, the б░blended visionб▒ with the LAL works even better than monovision.

Thus far, the LAL appears to perform as predicted enabling patients to see far/mid and near with minimal to no reliance on glasses and with excellent night vision without significant halos.

In this video, we follow a patient who initially received the panoptix lens, and though he saw perfectly on-paper, he was dissatisfied with his subjective vision.

VwklHZFJ02Q,lens;phaco;cataract;lensectomy;,"Cataract/Lens Replacement Surgery to both eyes on the same day - How and why? Shannon Wong,MD","If you are having elective eye surgery such as premium cataract or premium lens replacement surgery that is not paid for by your insurance company then you have a choice to have one eye treated one day and the other eye treated on a different day OR you can choose to have surgery to both eyes on the same day.

In 2023, we started performing same day bilateral premium lens replacement surgery in our ambulatory surgical center here in Austin.  (Our ASC is fully accredited by medicare, the state of Texas health and human services commission and AAAHC).

For what circumstances do we perform same day bilateral (simultaneous bilateral) premium lens replacement?
1 To reduce patient anxiety.  Letбпs face it, if you are having surgery, do you want to go through the surgery process twice on two different days or would you rather go through the surgical process once in a single day?  Patients choosing same day bilateral surgery just want to have a one and done type of experience.
2 Patient convenience:  If we perform surgery to one eye, then have that patient return for a follow-up visit or two before performing surgery on the second eye, then perform additional follow-up visits for the second eye, then we are asking the patient to make twice the number of visits to our offices than we would if we simply did surgery to both eyes on the same day.  Same day bilateral surgery patients get back to a normal routine sooner and have to take less time off from work than patients who have separate eyes done on separate days. 
3 Patients that are very dependent on glasses or contacts to see.  If a patient requires a high or strong prescription to see and we bring one eye into focus, then their visual experience will be imbalanced in the time period between surgeries if performed on different days.  Same day bilateral surgical patients can get back to a normal schedule of activities sooner because their vision will be more balanced and their eyes will work together within one day.
4 Elective surgery only. For patients using their medical insurance or medicare, we only do surgery to one eye on one day and for insurance reimbursement reasons do not offer same day bilateral surgery.

In this video, weбпll show you our process for a patient undergoing same day bilateral premium lens replacement.

The patient wanted expanded range of vision greater than the range of vision that he was experiencing with the Vivity lens.  We chose to perform intraocular lens exchange - remove his Vivity lens (post YAG capsulotomy) in the absence of a posterior capsule then insert a panoptix lens in a reverse optic capture configuration.

PmifZHq1eH4,lens;,"The Clearview 3 Multifocal Lens.  First Impressions.  Less Halos than PanOptix? Shannon Wong, MD.","The ClearView 3 Multifocal lens implant is a lens implant that enables patients to see far, mid and near without glasses and while providing great vision at night with minimal halos around lights at night.

We present our first case using the ClearView 3 multifocal lens implant in a patient who was seeing great with his PanOptix lens implants but was bothered by halos around lights at night seen with the panoptix lenses.

We performed intraocular lens exchange - removed his panoptix lens from his right eye - and placed a Clearview 3 multifocal lens into his right eye.

One day after surgery, his far/mid and near vision were comparable to the range of vision with the panoptix.  Importantly he did not perceive halos around lights through the Clearview 3 lens implant.

Shannon Wong, MD.","Premium Lens Replacement (aka Refractive Lens Exchange) or PLR is a very safe and effective treatment to enable people age 45 and older to see at all distances - far/mid/near - without glasses.

Surprisingly, most of the general public is unaware that PLR is an excellent option to help people see younger, without glasses and will obviate the need for future cataract surgery.

We share a nice story of a gentleman who traveled from Salisbury, UK in England to see us in Austin, TX for his premium lens replacement.  He shares his story in this video.

Alejandro Guerra and Dr Victor Flores from Vision Express Medical in Saint Lucia show their new technique in a 56 years old female patient with myopic traction maculopathy with lamellar macular hole and macular retinal detachment in her left eye. In this unique approach after the ILM is peeled, the peripheral retina is detached and relaxed with a retinotomy. So the retina glides over the posterior staphyloma to be definitely reattached with the macular hole closed under gas tamponade. Stable fluidics provided by the Continuous Flow Cutter and SPEEP pump from the OS 4.

TD0uBSz1x0s,punctal occlusion;tear duct;punctal occlusion;corneal;,"Punctal occlusion for treatment of Dry Eye.  Shannon Wong, MD 11-17-19","One of the most common eye conditions that ophthalmologists see is Dry Eye Syndrome.

It is so common that basically everyone experiences dry eye symptoms as part of the normal aging process.

Here we see a normal corneal surface иC it is smooth and clear иC like glass.

On the opposite eye, we see small opaque cells on the corneal surface.  These cells are dessicated causing the corneal surface to lose transparency and smoothness thus reducing this patientбпs visual clarity.

A common treatment for dry eye involves placement of a silicone plug to block one of the two tear ducts that allow tears manufactured on the ocular surface to drain from the eye into the nose.

A silicone plug can be inserted quickly and painlessly with eyedrop anesthetic.  The procedure takes seconds to perform and patients can experience significant improvement in their dry eye symptoms within days.  

Thank you for watching.  Have a wonderful day.",Dry eye,silicone plugs,restasis,xiidra,artificial tears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
