In the video shown here, the cost to perform this surgery is very low with no specialized instruments such as diamond burrs needed. Also the safety margin is very high given the techniques used so the risk of iatrogenic damage such as medial rectus injury or corneal perforation is very low. This is an ideal beginner technique to learn since it can then be refined in the future with fancier options such as the aforementioned diamond burr, more detailed dissection, an amniotic membrane, and anti-metabolites such as mitomycin-C.",cataract,cataract surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,cataract los angeles,cataract surgery los angeles,pterygium,pterygia

Nair, Mumbai","Chalazion: Incision & Curettage - (I & C) is a quick, safe, painless and scarless procedure that is used to completely remove the chalazion. A chalazion is a small, slow-growing lump that forms in the eyelid. They are not usually painful and rarely last longer than a few weeks. A chalazion develops when a meibomian gland on the eyelid becomes blocked or inflamed. The procedure takes less than 10 minutes and recovery is usually a few hours. 

Dr. Akshay G. Nair, Mumbai is an oculoplastic surgeon who specialises in treating eyelid disorders such as chalazion.

I really enjoyed watching this video of Prof. Hosam Elfallal from Mansoura University in Egypt. He has an innovative technique for the surgical treatment of pterygia without the need for a conjunctival graft or amniotic tissue. His technique involves dissecting the tenon layer more than the conjunctiva so that there is a tenon-free zone of about 2 mm. Once the conjunctiva seals down onto the sclera, the tenon layer is sequestered and locked in place. This helps to prevent recurrence of the pterygium. The rest of the sclera becomes covered in epithelial cells as the eye heals during the post-op period. The results look great.",cataract,cataract surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,cataract los angeles,cataract surgery los angeles,pterygia,pterygium,pterygium surgery,pterygia surgery

6WEGMW6xdqE,eyelid;dacryocystorhinostomy;orbital;,Sunken eye correction - Medial canthopexy - Orbit Reconstruction,"This is a 26-old male who sought treatment for his left sunken eye with constant tearing from left eye. He had been diagnosed with a rare bone disease called fibrous dysplasia at the age of 12 years. In this disease, the bone is slowly replaced with fibrous tissue and the growth of the tissue assumes large proportion. For this patient, the disease was limited to only the orbital bone part. In this disease process, all body cavities and structures, there is progressive deposition of this abnormal bone. As the orbit (eye socket) bones were pressing the eye, 8 years back, a surgery was performed to relieve the pressure on the eyeball. The result of this surgery leads to improper positioning of the eyeball in the eye socket, resulting in sunken misplaced left eye. Also, as a result of the surgery, there was a constant overflow of tears from the left eye.
 
The current treatment plan is to correct, shape the orbit and position the eyeball correctly. All this procedure needs to be performed without affecting the vision and delicate optic nerve. Lastly, the tear ducts are also to be corrected. All surgery was approached through previous scars itself. An upper eyelid incision was placed just below the upper eyebrow along previous scars. Through this incision and a sub-ciliary incison, the bone of the upper margin was shaped. All removed bone was carefully salvaged. Through an inferior medial canthus region, the lower eyelid region was approached. In the lower margin, preparation of the bone was done. Eye tissues were carefully dislodged at needed areas. The salvaged bones were placed and screwed. This gave a new, improved frame work for the orbit.
 
The punctum of tear gland were identified. A delicate silicon tube was carefully inserted and the blocks removed. The tube was retrieved through an artificial opening in to inferior nasal meatus in the nasal cavity.  By the suturing of the ductal mucosa with the nasal mucosa, the patency is ensured. By this surgery called dacryocystorhinostomy, the tears are redirected in to nasal mucosa so that there is no excess tear overflow.
 
A modified “Y” medial canthoplexy was performed to ensure the proper positioning of the eye socket and eyeball. This was a customized technique developed at BDCH. This results in perfectly looking eye socket and eyeball. After the procedure, all movements of eye ball indicated that there had been no damage to the functioning of eye, indicating the complete success of the surgery.",Dr SM Balaji,Balaji Dental Hospital,Maxillofacial Surgeon,Cleft Palate Surgery,Dental Surgeon,Orbit (Anatomical Structure),Health (Industry),Medial canthopexy,Sunken eye correction,Orbit Reconstruction,SM BALAJI,eye surgery,cosmetic surgery,Eye (Quotation Subject),dacryocystorhinostomy,fibrous dysplasia
zdDvLt7qvqY,eyelid;muscle;,Upper eyelid tarsotomy for cicatricial entropion,"An upper eyelid tarsotomy is usually performed for moderate amounts of cicatricial entropion.  It is important to make sure that there is no active inflammatory process -- if there is active inflammation which has caused the problem, making an incision in the inflamed conjunctiva may make the process worse.  I prefer this procedure for Meibomian gland dysfunction related (marginal) entropion as well as entropion in burned out trachoma.  

A written transcript of this video is as follows:

This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa.  This video demonstrates an upper eyelid tarsotomy with everting sutures for cicatricial entropion.  A 4-0 silk traction suture is placed and the eyelid is everted over a shoe horn speculum.  A 15 blade is then used to make an incision 2-3 mm from the eyelid margin full thickness through the tarsus along the extent of the area of entropion.   Westcott scissors are then used to complete the full thickness tarsal incision to the level of the pretarsal orbicularis muscle.  The pretarsal orbicularis muscle is visualized as demonstrated here.  This freely mobilizes the eyelid margin for eyelid eversion.  The traction suture is then removed.  A 5-0 Vicryl suture on an S-24 needle is then placed entering at the level of the lash follicles and exiting at the tarsal incision.  The cut edge of the tarsus is then engaged with the suture and the suture is turned around to exit at the level of the eyelash follicles.  This suture is left untied so that an adjacent suture can be placed easily.  Again, the suture is placed through the eyelid at the level of the eyelash follicles.  The suture then engages the cut edge of the tarsus, then the suture is turned around to exit at the level of the eyelash follicles.  To demonstrate this one last time, the suture enters at the eyelash follicles, engages the cut edge of the tarsus, followed by exiting at the lash follicles.  The sutures are then tied and tying the suture should result in eversion of the eyelid margin.  I have yet to over correct a patient with this procedure.  Approximately 3-6 sutures are placed. At the end of the case the eyelid margin should be everted.  Antibiotic ointment is then placed into the eye and the sutures are removed at 7-10 days.

yADhAypxNEc,eyelid;conjunctival;orbital;muscle;,Repair of 100% lower eyelid defect,"This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa.

This video demonstrates the repair of the entire lower eyelid.

The patient is a Mohs excision of a basal cell carcinoma. The lower canaliculus is involved. A Crawford stent is introduced into the cut end of the lower canaliculus, down the nasolacrimal duct, and retrieved from the nose. The other end of the Crawford stent is then placed through the upper system and retrieved from the nose. Attention is then directed to the defect. Examination shows that there is no evidence of any tarsus left. However, there does appear to be adequate anterior lamella. 

Dissection is then carried out between the orbicularis muscle and orbital septum to the inferior orbital rim. A lateral canthotomy is performed with further dissection to the lateral orbital rim between the orbicularis muscle and orbital septum. The lateral orbital rim is exposed. Mobilization of the anterior lamella shows that it should be able to cover any posterior lamellar reconstruction.
The upper eyelid is everted over a shoe horn speculum. The tarsus is inspected. A mark is made 4 mm superior to the inferior border of the tarsus. As much tarsus as possible will be taken along the length of the eyelid. A 15 blade will then be used to make an incision along the length of the tarsus of the upper lid to take as much tarsus as possible. Westcott scissors are then used to raise the flap. 

Dissection is carried out along the anterior surface of the tarsus. The flap is then mobilized by dissecting between the conjunctiva and the Muller muscle. It is important to keep Muller muscle out of the flap to prevent post-operative upper lid retraction. Further dissection is carried out along the surface of the conjunctiva to the superior fornix. The thinness of the flap is demonstrated. This will be transposed medially and sutured to the remnant of the medial canthal tendon. This is sutured into position with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Two sutures are placed. The stent is positioned to exit posterior to the Hughes flap.

Attention is then directed laterally where a significant defect is still apparent in the posterior lamella. Realistically it is difficult to use a Hughes flap alone to repair a defect of the entire lower eyelid. Dissection is then carried out inferiorly between the conjunctiva and lower lid retractors. The dissection plane is demonstrated. This conjunctival will be sutured to the inferior border of the posterior lamellar reconstruction.

A periosteal strip will then be elevated laterally. A 15 blade is used to make an incision through the periosteum. To elevate the strip, a Freer periosteal elevator is used. The strip is raised and reflected medially. Measuring between the Hughes flap and the strip shows that there is still a significant defect. This will be filled with a free tarsal graft from the contralateral upper eyelid. This is harvested with a 15 blade and Westcott scissors. Dissection is carried out similar to the Hughes flap along the anterior surface of the tarsus. The graft will be excised. Hemostasis is assured, but no repair needs to be done for the donor site.

The free tarsal graft is then sutured to the Hughes flap. This is performed with the same 5-0 Vicryl suture on the spatula needle. The free tarsal graft is sutured with a mattress suture to the periosteal strip with a 5-0 Vicryl suture on a taper needle so that the periosteal strip is situated anterior to the free tarsal graft. This results in repair of the posterior lamellar. A 7-0 Vicryl suture is placed at the junction of the free tarsal graft and the Hughes flap at the proposed lid margin. An additional suture is placed at the junction of the graft and the periosteal strip. The conjunctiva will then be sutured to the inferior border of the posterior lamellar repair. This is performed with a 7-0 Vicryl suture placed in a running fashion.  Retractors have been dissected from the conjunctiva to prevent post-operative lid retraction. This is performed along the length of the repair.

A 4-0 Vicryl suture is used to engage the lateral soft tissue of the cheek and this is then sutured to the periosteum of the lateral orbital rim to provide lateral support of the myocutaneous advancement flap.

The myocutaneous advancement flap is then sutured to the anterior surface of the free tarsal graft with a 5-0 Vicryl suture in a mattress fashion. A similar suture is placed through the Hughes flap. These sutures are tied over bolsters. The superior edge of the myocutaneous advancement flap is then sutured to the superior boarder of the Hughes flap with interrupted and running 7-0 Vicryl sutures. This fixates the superior edge of the flap to the superior edge of the future lid margin. The lateral canthotomy incision is closed with the same 7-0 Vicryl suture.

2IKS6JWz89I,eyelid;muscle;,Biggest Eyelid Bag Ever,"Dr. Joe Niamtu, III, cosmetic facial surgeon in Richmond, Virginia shows a case of extreme lower eyelid fat pads.  This case represents laser removal of lower lid fat in a patient with exceptionally large fat pads.  
The eyes are called the ""seat of the soul"" and are one of our most attractive features in youth.  Studies have shown that when we first view a person, we make hundreds of subconscious impressions based upon the persons features and invariability, the first thing we look at are the person's eyes.

As we age, we experience changes with the skin, bone, muscle and fat of the eyelid regions.  On of the main changes that happens is the development of ""fat bags"" especially on the lower eyelids.

The eye is naturally surrounded by a generous layer of fat to protect and cushion the eyeball.  As we age, the tissues that normally keep the fat in place begin to weaken and the fat protrudes and becomes apparent.  In addition, the skin of the eyelids becomes very wrinkled.

Cosmetic blepharoplasty is a procedure that reduces the protruding fat and rejuvenates the aging skin.  Dr. Niamtu performs blepharoplasty with lasers which prevent bleeding and enable faster and less painful recovery with minimal bruising.  He also employs a surgical approach that keeps the laser incision scar inside the lower eyelid so it is not visible.  This video shows a patient with very large lower eyelid (and upper) bags being treated by Dr. Niamtu with the CO2 laser.  This case represents extreme fat protrusion and the patient has much less fat to be reduced.

7Rltb9vqDXk,eyelid;lacrimal;orbital;,Resection of prolapsed orbital fat into the subconjunctival space,"Fat that prolapses into the subconjunctival space should be differentiated from a dermolipoma (lipodermoid) as well as lymphoma. Usually, it is pretty obvious as to what it is. The patients are almost always older and there have been associations reported with thyroid eye disease and floppy eyelid syndrome. This is actually orbital fat that has migrated anteriorly due to weakened orbital septa. I think it is good to not be too aggressive in excision to avoid an orbital hemorrhage. 

For a written transcript of this video, please see below:

This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa. 

This video demonstrates resection of prolapsed orbital fat into the subconjunctival space. 

It is important to differentiate this condition from a lipodermoid.  Often the patients will have bilateral prolapsed fat. The area is anesthetized with lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient usually tolerates the procedure well with just local anesthesia.  Westcott scissors are used to make an incision through the conjunctiva at the medial extent of the lesion.  The fat is then encountered and dissection is carried out around the fat to mobilize it.  Usually the fat is relatively mobile and not much dissection will need to be carried out.  Superiorly, it is important to not dissect too high into the region of the lacrimal gland.  This could potentially damage the lacrimal gland ductules and cause a dry eye.  After the fat is mobilized, Westcott scissors can be used to resect the prolapsed fat at its base. One could use cautery here to prevent hemorrhage.  I consciously do not pull too hard on the fat or cut quickly without checking for hemorrhage.  I do not think that you have to chase fat that is posterior. One should also be cognizant of the proximity of the lateral rectus muscle.  After hemostasis is assured, the conjunctiva can be closed with superficial, interrupted 7-0 Vicryl sutures with the knots buried.  At the conclusion of the case, the patient will used antibiotic ointment three times per day and return in approximately 1-2 weeks for reevaluation.

A_bQAbuNJN8,eyelid;orbital;muscle;,Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with fat repositioning,"There are many ways to perform a lower lid blepharoplasty, and the technique should be tailored to the patient. The main issues are the following: should fat be repositioned or resected; should the incision be transconjunctival or trancutaneous; should the eyelid be tightened, and if so, what lid tightening procedure should be used; and should the mid-face be supported. Of course, there are other issues as well, but I think that these are the main ones to consider.

For a written transcript of this video, please see below:

This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa. This video demonstrates a lower lid blepharoplasty with transposition of the medial and central fat pads through a transconjunctival incision.

A 4-0 silk suture is placed through the lower lid at the level of the meibomian gland orifices to provide traction during the case. A trans-upper eyelid canthopexy will also be performed to stabilize the lower lid.

A pinch excision has been marked and this is incised with the 15 blade. This should not extend medial to the medial limbus.

Skin without orbicularis is excised.

A transconjunctival incision is then made with the needle tip cautery extending from the punctum medially to the lateral canthus laterally.

Dissection is then carried out between the orbicularis muscle and orbital septum to the inferior orbital rim.

Once the inferior orbital rim is identified, dissection is carried out inferior to the inferior orbital rim with a freer periosteal elevator in a preperiosteal plane.

4-0 silk suture is then placed through the edge of the conjunctiva to provide traction during the case.

The fats pads are then identified by dissecting through the orbital septum.

The medial and central fats pads are mobilized; between the two runs the inferior oblique muscle.

The lateral fat pad is mobilized and this fat pad is usually conservatively excised.

However, in this patient, the medial and central fat pads will be transposed over the inferior orbital rim in order to fill out the tear trough.

A 4-0 prolene suture is placed through the skin and orbicularis and retrieved.

The suture then engages the medial fat pad and then place back through the orbicularis muscle and skin. This results in transposition of the medial fat pad over the orbital rim.

The same is done to the central fat pad.

These sutures are tied over a bolster and then taken out at the one week follow up.

Unfortunately in this video the trans-upper eyelid canthopexy is not well visualized. Therefore, the transconjunctival incision is closed with a 7-0 vicryl suture. The pinch exicision of skin is closed with interrupted 6-0 prolene suture.

Complex Eyelid Neurofibroma Excision-Step by Step Surgery 

This video demonstrates the surgical resection of plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid along with eyelid reconstruction. 

The horizontal eyelid length is first marked comparing with the other side. Then the eyelid crease is marked by comparing with another side. The excess periorbital tissue is marked in an elliptical manner. The excess full-thickness eyelid is marked as a pentagon on the lateral side of the eyelid.
Local infiltration is given with lignocaine with adrenaline. Lid traction sutures are taken with 5-0 mersilk.

The lid crease incision is taken and the neurofibromatosis tissue is debulked. Generally, this tumor bleeds more during surgery due to the presence of immature vessels within the tumor. Lateral pentagon full-thickness eyelid tissue is then excised. This excision can have differential removal of the anterior and posterior lamella. The periorbital ellipse is then excised. Sub conjunctival lignocaine injection is used to dissect the tumor tissue from the conjunctiva. In this patient, the neurofibromatosis tissue was present posterior to the levator too. The levator muscle was separated from the tumor tissue both anteriorly as well as posteriorly. The horizontal eyelid length is again verified before complete excision of the lateral pentagon. 

Once the levator dissection is complete, the lateral horn is cut followed by the medial horn. The neurofibromatosis tissue posterior to the levator is seen here. Excess post lamella including tarsus and conjunctiva along with tumor tissue is excised after marking. The cut edges are sutured with 6-0 vicryl. Three horizontal mattress sutures are taken on the levator at the desired height and passed through the tarsus. The lid height and contour are checked by asking the patient to look straight. Once the desired height and contour is achieved the excess levator is excised and the sutures are finalized. 

A strip is fashioned at the lateral end of the tarsus and is anchored to the periosteum at the superolateral orbital margin with a 5-0 prolene mattress suture. The periorbital incision is closed with 5-0 vicryl and 6-0 prolene in two layers. Debulking is completed. Lateral canthal forming suture is then taken with 5-0 prolene. Excess skin is excised near the lid crease. Lid crease-forming sutures are taken by including the levator in the skin bites.

xqhIuyL_jco,eyelid;orbital;muscle;,Maximal repair of involutional lower lid ectropion,"This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa.  

This video demonstrates repair of significant lower eyelid involutional ectropion with a combination of horizontal tightening, inverting sutures, cheek support, and a medial tarsorrhaphy.  A 4-0 silk suture is placed through the lower lid at the level of the meibomian gland orifices.  A lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis are then performed.  A transconjunctival incision is then made inferior to the inferior border of the tarsus extending from the punctum medially to the lateral canthotomy incision laterally.  Dissection is then carried out between the orbicularis muscle and orbital septum to the inferior orbital rim.  A freer periosteal elevator is then used to dissect in a preperiosteal plane inferior to the inferior orbital rim.  A 4-0 vicryl suture is then used to engage the soft tissue of the cheek followed by the periosteum of the inferior orbital rim to support the cheek.  This is essentially a SOOF lift.  An additional suture is placed in the same manner centrally and then laterally.  This results in adequate support of the cheek.  Inverting sutures are the placed through the skin and orbicularis muscle, followed by the inferior border of the tarsus. The 5-0 vicryl suture is then placed through the orbicularis and skin to exit out next to the entry site. This is approximately one cm inferior to the inferior border of the tarsus.  Three sutures are placed along the width of the lower eyelid.  These sutures are left untied.  The transconjunctival is then closed with interrupted 7-0 vicryl sutures.  Usually about 4 sutures are needed. 

Attention is then directed to the lateral tarsal strip.  Dissection is carried out between the anterior and posterior lamella for approximately one cm.  The mucocutaneous junction of the posterior lamella is excised followed by scraping the posterior surface of the posterior lamella.  The strip is then shortened the appropriate amount and a double armed 4-0 mersilene suture is used to engage the strip.  This suture then engages the periosteum of the lateral orbital rim at the level of Whitnalls tubercle.  Prior to tying the strip, the lateral portion of the mucocutaneous junction of the upper eyelid is excised.  This is then engaged with a 5-0 Vicryl suture followed by passing the suture through the superior edge of the strip.  The results in incorporation of the lateral upper lid into the lateral tarsal strip. Tying the mersilene suture results in tightening the lower and upper eyelids. The excess portion of the anterior lamella is excised.  The canthotomy incision is then closed with interrupted 7-0 vicryl sutures.

A medial tarsorrhaphy is then performed by making a V shaped excision extending from the lower lid to the upper lid.  Dissection is then performed between the anterior and posterior lamella.  The posterior lamella is then sutured together with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl suture.  Two sutures are usually needed.  The anterior lamella is then closed with interrupted 7-0 vicryl sutures.

The inverting sutures are then tied.  These can be tied over bolsters if desired. In this case bolsters are not used.  The suture is tied at a tension in order to make the lower eyelid lashes vertical.  At the conclusion of the case the eyelid appears to be in good position.  Antibiotic ointment is placed over the repair and the patient returns in one week for suture removal.

u-ye-l7ZBCs,eyelid;conjunctival;orbital;muscle;,External levator advancement,"My mainstay for ptosis repair is a levator advancement, although I have been doing more and more MMCRs (Muller muscle – conjunctival resection) with time. I think it is key to identify the preaponeurotic fat. I absolutely love using a high temperature cautery for the dissection of the levator aponeurosis from the underlying Muller muscle. Usually I can get the contour right with a single pass of the double-armed 5-0 Nylon suture. Sometimes (especially in children) I need to place a temporal suture.

For a written transcript of this video, please see below:

This is Richard Allen at the University of Iowa. This video demonstrates an external levator advancement. This is an adult patient. A 15 blade is used to make an incision through the skin and orbicularis muscle along the eyelid crease. In this case, a small blepharoplasty is also performed. Westcott scissors are then used to excise the skin and orbicularis muscle. The monopolar cautery is then used to dissect through the orbital septum. The goal of this dissection is to identify the preaponeurotic fat which is posterior to the orbital septum. The thermal cautery is used to perform additional dissection until the preaponeurotic fat is identified. The preaponeurotic fat is then dissected from the underlying levator aponeurosis. As you can see in this case, there is a fair amount of fat in the levator muscle. A thermal cautery is then used to disinsert the levator aponeurosis from the anterior surface of the tarsus. Dissection is then carried out between the levator aponeurosis and the underlying mullers muscle with the thermal cautery. This can at times be uncomfortable for the patient and topical tetracaine can be used to relieve any discomfort. The assistant then holds mullers muscle which can also be somewhat uncomfortable for the patient. As you can see in this case, the patient also has fat in the mullers muscle. Dissection is carried out until the end of the aponeurosis and can be carried out further in more severe cases of ptosis. A double armed 5-0 nylon suture on a spatula needle is then placed partial thickness through the anterior surface of the tarsus, 2 mm inferior to the superior boarder of the tarsus. This is placed at the area where the peak of the eyelid should be. Each of the needles is then placed through the levator aponeurosis. In this case the sutures are placed right at the junction of the aponeurosis and the muscular portion of the levator, which I think is a good place to start. A temporary tie is then placed. The patient then opens his or her eyes. In almost all of my adult patients, I place the patient in a sitting position at this point in the surgery to inspect the height and contour. In this case, it was determined that the height was a bit too high, therefore the sutures are positioned more inferior on the aponeurosis and a temporary tie is again placed. The height and contour are reinspected and found to be acceptable. The temporary tie is now converted to a permanent tie. A portion of the redundant levator aponeurosis is excised and the skin is closed by placing approximately three lid crease formation sutures. This suture incorporates the cut end of the levator aponeurosis into the skin closure. This is performed with a 6-0 prolene suture. Additonal interrupted sutures are placed. Antibiotic ointment is placed over the incision and the patient will return in one week for suture removal.

A middle aged man was referred for correction of aphakia following previous complicated cataract surgery. 

A vitrectomy with implantation of a Zeiss CT Lucia 202 lens using a modified Yamane technique was performed. At the end of the operation the IOL was inspected carefully and confirmed to be in an excellent position with no significant tilt or decentration.

At the first post-operative visit, the IOL was found to be very tilted along the axis of the haptic-optic junctions. At 3 weeks post-op the IOL position was unchanged. 

The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20/200 due to a high degree of astigmatism induced by the IOL tilting.

The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/25 with a correction of +0.25/-6.50 x 170°.

Numerous similar cases of a rotisserie style rotation of the CT Lucia lens have been reported and hypothesized to be due to loss of structural integrity at the optic-haptic junction.

A laser lock technique to correct IOL tilt was reported by Drs D Scoles and J Wolf (Laser to the rescue.  AAO.org. Dec, 2022): https://www.aao.org/education/1-minute-video/laser-to-rescue-2

The laser lock technique was used in this case to reposition and lock the IOL into a stable horizontal planar position without tilt.

At 4 days following surgery the IOL position was stable with no significant tilt. The UCVA improved to 20/30 due to reduction of the astigmatism previously induced by the tilted IOL.
The BCVA improved to 20/20 with a correction  +0.25/-0.75x180°.

A middle aged woman complained of an 18 month history of blurred vision and floaters.

Pre-op visual acuity = 6/9 (20/30)
Massive vitreous floaters were visible behind an intraocular lens.
The view of the retina was obscured by the floaters located in the visual axis.

Surgery consisted of a 25 gauge sutureless Floater Only Vitrectomy (FOV).

Post-op visual acuity = 6/6 (20/20)
No residual floaters were present and the retina was easily visualised.

Management options for symptomatic floaters include:
1. Conservative observation
2. YAG laser vitreolysis
3. Floater Only Vitrectomy (FOV)

Each option has pros & cons and the treatment should be tailored to the individual patient depending upon symptoms, clinical findings and personal preference after consultation with an experienced retinal surgeon.

The advantage of Floater Only Vitrectomy is complete or nearly complete removal of floaters and excellent symptom relief. 
The risks of surgery include cataract (if cataract has not previously been performed), retinal detachment, infection, intraocular haemorrhage, macular oedema.

A 72 year old man presented with loss of vision due to spontaneous dislocation of an intraocular lens/capsular bag complex onto the retina.

Uncorrected Visual Acuity = Counting Fingers

The surgical procedure consisted of:

1. Making slit-like tunnels in the nasal and temporal cornea/sclera (Hoffman pockets) - these are used later to retrieve IOL fixation sutures and avoid the need for conjunctival dissection/sutures/scleral flaps often needed with many alternative IOL fixation techniques

2. 25 gauge vitrectomy. The IOL is lying upside down on the macula the IOP is lowered and raised quickly to flip it  180 degrees upside down onto the correct orientation. 25 gauge micro-forceps are used to pick up the IOL/capsular bag complex off the macula and into the pupil plane

3. Passage of a needle/suture through the sclera (via the Hoffman pocket) below one IOL haptic, then another needle/suture above the IOL haptic - this creates a lasso loop around the haptic to fix it to the ciliary sulcus and sclera.

4. The IOL is placed back on top of the macula to allow the opposite haptic to be grasped and brought back to the iris plane. Sutures are passed above and below that haptic so that both haptics are now held by suture loops.

5. A vitrectomy probe is used to remove the residual white Soemmering ring (residual proliferative lens cortex material from previous cataract surgery) and the IOL is centred in position. The contraction of the lens epithelial cells and cortex probably contributed to the IOL dislocation by contracting and breaking zonules.

6. The sutures are tensioned to centre the IOL and tied to complete the operation.

The visual acuity at 4 days post op was 6/6 (20/20) with -0.50/-0.75 x 105. The IOL was well centred and stable

The visual acuity and IOL remained stable when reviewed 2 years post-op.

This technique which avoids the downsides of alternatives such as IOL explantation with insertion of a large anterior chamber IOL or iris clipped IOL e.g. large corneal wound with induced astigmatism, corneal endothelial cell trauma, need for peripheral iridectomy, longer healing time, cost of new IOL, potential biometry errors, additional sutures etc.

A 38 year old man reported poor vision due to dislocation of an intraocular lens onto the retina.
Uncorrected Visual Acuity preop = Counting Fingers only

Cataract surgery had been performed 10 years ago for a juvenile cataract.
1 month prior to this presentation, the IOL had spontaneously subluxed out of the capsular bag and was treated with surgical repositioning of the haptics into the sulcus and the optic behind the anterior capsule (optic capture) with a good initial result. However, the IOL subsequently dislocated completely into the posterior segment.

Surgery consists of a 25g vitrectomy with repositioning of the IOL (an Alcon MA60AC 3 piece  acrylic IOL) using 25g forceps and the distal haptic technique. The IOL is fixated to the sclera using Yamane's double needle technique with loop cautery to mould the haptic tips into terminal flanges/bulbs. 

At day 4 post-op, the uncorrected visual acuity was 6/6 (20/20) with a stable well positioned IOL.

Thyroid eye disease in its active phase can last for 1.5 to 2 years. That means if it is left untreated, the inflammation may gradually decrease by itself but may cause damage to vision through the course of the disease.

Bulgy eyes/ proposed eyes/big eyes due to the thyroid can be socially embarrassing. The eye does not go back to normal on its own in the inactive phase. After being stable for several months or more, it is desirable to surgically move the eye into a more normal position. Orbital Decompression/Eye decompression surgery is performed under general anesthesia. Orbital decompression surgery is designed to remove bone and/or fat from behind the eye, allowing the eye to move back into its socket. The surgery makes more room behind the eye for the enlarged muscles that have developed with the disease. The surgeon works through hidden incisions in the upper eyelid crease, through the caruncle(inner corner of the eye), and through the inside of the lower eyelid. 

The bulk of recovery from orbital decompression surgery occurs within 20 to 30 days. Pain medications help patients manage the mild to moderate discomfort they may experience during the first 7 to 8 days after surgery.

Orbital tumor removal- Treatment of bulgy eye/Proptosis

This video demonstrates the surgical technique of orbital tumor excision. The patient had proptosis/protrusion of the eyeball and downward displacement of the eyeball. The tumor was huge approximately 22x24x25mm which is larger than the eyeball size. The tumor had enlarged the bony orbit and the patient has explained chances of enophthalmos post-op.

The long-standing tumor had also compressed the superior rectus muscle.
The lid crease was marked first comparing with the other eye. The surgery was performed using an operating microscope.  Lid traction sutures were taken with 5-0 Mersilk. Superior rectus muscle was tagged with 50 Mersilk suture. The orbicularis was dissected. The periosteum was exposed near the orbital margin. The orbital septum was opened near the orbital margin. The tumor was exposed by gently separating the orbital tissues. The supraorbital nerve is seen medially and was found to be wrapped around the tumor superiorly as it continued as frontal nerve. As the tumor was cystic, I decompressed it by aspirating the contents so that there is more space available for dissection. 
The pupil was checked frequently during surgery to make sure there is no pressure on the nerve with the retractors or direct trauma. The tumor was gently held with a cryoprobe and removed. The nerve was separated from the tumor by blunt dissection before removal. The nerve is seen intact at the end of the surgery and also the superior rectus muscle was intact. The tumor bed was clean with no bleeders at the end of the surgery. A capillary drain was placed and the wound closed with 6-0 prolene sutures.

Evisceration with ball implant and ocular prosthetic eye/artificial eye fitting
This video demonstrates evisceration with ball implant surgery for a young boy with a cosmetically disfiguring blind eye. He had no potential for vision in that eye and the surgery was performed to improve cosmesis and help in placing a prosthesis.

This procedure can be performed for painful blind eyes, cosmetic improvement in blind sunken eye / physical eye, contracted socket, disfigured eye after injury /trauma, or chemical eye burn or thermal eye injury. This is a cosmetic surgery done in the eyes with no chances of regaining vision. The implant fills the empty space after the eyeball is removed due to trauma or surgery or a loss of volume due to shrinkage of an eye. Once the volume is filled, the eye shell or prosthetic eye fitting is better and the artificial eye also has moved to a certain extent. Orbital surgery with an implant is safe and with the right technique, the chances of complications like exposure, infection, extrusion of the implant are minimum.
This patient was happy after artificial eye fitting /prosthesis fitting. He was more confident and was able to walk around without embarrassment. 
The prosthetic eye / artificial eye can have a life-like appearance. The color is exactly matched by looking at the other eye by our expert ocularist who customizes the prosthesis for every patient. 
Here are some of our happy patients.
Surgery with an implant corrects the volume and surface so that an appropriate bed is created to place a prosthesis. Sometimes this surgery can be combined with additional procedures like eyelid surgery or mucous membrane grafting (lining from lip or cheek) to improve the cosmetic appearance and create a beautiful eye.

dtO7xjlXrNw,eyelid;orbital;,Blepharoplasty Surgery | Asian Blepharoplasty |  Surgical Video  - Dr.Priti Udhay,"The marking is done in a sitting position. Marking is explained in another video on my channel. The incision is taken with monopolar radiofrequency cautery which improves precision in my opinion as compared to a surgical knife. Only skin is excised in most cases. In some patients especially Asians when you want to reduce the bulk,orbicularis is also excised. I excise the superior portion of the orbicularis in most cases and the inferior portion is left behind to give volume. 

I also excise the entire lateral portion of the orbicularis which has vertical fibers which are brow depressors. This helps correct the lateral brow droop to some extent. The septum is then opened. The medial and central fat pads are dissected. Note that the medial fat pad which has a neuroectodermal origin is whiter than the center which has a mesodermal origin and is more yellow. In this patient, I have conservatively excised the medial and central prolapsed fat pad. This can be done with radiofrequency cautery or clamped and cut. The vessels should be adequately cauterized before leaving the stump otherwise the bleeder may retract into the orbit and cause orbital hemorrhage. 

In this patient, I have excised the orbicularis to reduce the volume of the upper eyelid as the eyelid appeared bulky even after fat excision. In Asian eyelids like this, deep bites on the levator should be included in the skin bites to form a good eyelid crease as shown here. The skin is then closed with  6-0 prolene interrupted sutures. A similar procedure is performed on the other side.

Ptosis , post trauma is most difficult to treat as the anatomy is distorted and it is difficult to dissect the levator muscle from the scar tissue. Dissecting the levator off the conjunctiva first and then proceeding to anterior tissues is helpful. Using a sub conjunctival injection of lignocaine with adrenaline helps in hydrodissection as well as hemostasis .The anterior lamellar shortage can be treated by scar revision with multiple Z Plasties or a full thickness skin graft. The lacrimal drainage system should always be examined in post trauma cases and any abnormality can be delt with simultaneously so that the scar can be planned well. Medial canthoplasty is essential in certain cases. This video demonstrates one such case of ptosis in which lacrimal sac was excised, scar tissue removed, multiple Z Plasties was performed along with levator resection. The bony orbit should be reconstructed ideally prior to lid surgery. However this patient did not consent for the same. Minimum usage of cautery  and post operative use of 5-FU injections reduces scarring.

Complex Eyelid Neurofibroma Excision-Step by Step Surgery 

This video demonstrates the surgical resection of plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid along with eyelid reconstruction. 

The horizontal eyelid length is first marked comparing with the other side. Then the eyelid crease is marked by comparing with another side. The excess periorbital tissue is marked in an elliptical manner. The excess full-thickness eyelid is marked as a pentagon on the lateral side of the eyelid.
Local infiltration is given with lignocaine with adrenaline. Lid traction sutures are taken with 5-0 mersilk.

The lid crease incision is taken and the neurofibromatosis tissue is debulked. Generally, this tumor bleeds more during surgery due to the presence of immature vessels within the tumor. Lateral pentagon full-thickness eyelid tissue is then excised. This excision can have differential removal of the anterior and posterior lamella. The periorbital ellipse is then excised. Sub conjunctival lignocaine injection is used to dissect the tumor tissue from the conjunctiva. In this patient, the neurofibromatosis tissue was present posterior to the levator too. The levator muscle was separated from the tumor tissue both anteriorly as well as posteriorly. The horizontal eyelid length is again verified before complete excision of the lateral pentagon. 

Once the levator dissection is complete, the lateral horn is cut followed by the medial horn. The neurofibromatosis tissue posterior to the levator is seen here. Excess post lamella including tarsus and conjunctiva along with tumor tissue is excised after marking. The cut edges are sutured with 6-0 vicryl. Three horizontal mattress sutures are taken on the levator at the desired height and passed through the tarsus. The lid height and contour are checked by asking the patient to look straight. Once the desired height and contour is achieved the excess levator is excised and the sutures are finalized. 

A strip is fashioned at the lateral end of the tarsus and is anchored to the periosteum at the superolateral orbital margin with a 5-0 prolene mattress suture. The periorbital incision is closed with 5-0 vicryl and 6-0 prolene in two layers. Debulking is completed. Lateral canthal forming suture is then taken with 5-0 prolene. Excess skin is excised near the lid crease. Lid crease-forming sutures are taken by including the levator in the skin bites. Lower lid frost suture is taken which is retained for 24 -48 hours post-op.

-ypDd902r-8,eyelid;smile;,Dermis fat graft for contracted socket-Artificial eye surgery,"#ArtificialEyeSurgery #DermisFatGraft #Dr.Priti

This patient had a road traffic accident and his eyeball was severely damaged. His previous surgeon had removed the eyeball and placed an implant in the socket. However, the implant got exposed and infected. He again put in a smaller size implant. The second implant also extruded. His eye socket was shrunk and scarred and there was volume loss. The artificial eye could not be retained as the fornices were short and the pockets were not deep enough to retain the artificial eye. He needed both volume and surface augmentation. 

Cosmetically, an artificial eye may not look good if the bed is contracted and the fitting is poor and the eye will appear sunken if the volume is not replaced. A dermis fat graft provides both volume and surface area to a contracted bed. Once the graft heals, the socket then has good dimensions for fitting a well-made customized prosthesis. Generally, it takes 6-8 weeks for the graft to heal . Appropriate sizing and gentle technique can ensure less fat resorption and excellent cosmesis. 

Coping with eye loss can be stressful and a good custom artificial eye /ocular prosthesis /false eye fitting after appropriate socket surgery can be life-changing for the patient. This cosmetic surgery brought a smile to my patient. He now has improved self-confidence and is a senior executive in a corporate setup.

It can be unilateral (on one side) or bilateral (both sides).It is caused due to poor development of the muscle which lifts the eyelid or weakness of the muscle. Eyelid nerve damage can also lead to ptosis. Ptosis symptoms can be cosmetic(most common) or functional like brow ache or  decreased field of vision .Proper ptosis examination is a pre requisite to detect the type of ptosis and the cause for the ptosis in order to achieve satisfying results.

Intended for eye surgeons/ glaucoma specialists who want to master canaloplasty. Canaloplasty is a minimally invasive glaucoma treatment. Although technically challenging, Canaloplasty has several advantages over traditional glaucoma treatments/ surgeries, specially in its safety profile. 

=================  

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: And now what I'm doing is I'm just going to place a little viscoelastic on, now, that deep flap, and see if I can also get that locked into place using the bridle suture. Now that's going to keep from desiccating. Now I'll just take the viscoelastic, and I'm just going to dilate the ostia of Schlemm's canal here. And what that's going to do is it's just going to allow me to more easily cannulate with the iScience catheter. There are those who advocate that you actually place the tip of the viscoelastic cannula into Schlemm's canal.


So on the right here, you have the standard Fechtner conjunctival forceps. And they have a large ring, which is used to atraumatically grasp conjunctiva. But what you see on the left is a Mastel prototype of an instrument which I think is just absolutely wonderful for canaloplasty, and you'll see why in the next couple of minutes of this video.

This is a modification of the Fechtner forceps. And what's been done is you now have two loops, side by side, and you'll see just how wonderfully this can be used in canaloplasty for control. 

So I really prefer to use this combination of the Mastel modification and the regular Fechtner's for inserting the cannula. You'll see here, the catheter with the tip. And what's nice about this is that these side‑by‑side loops allow you to grasp the cannula in a way that just gives you full control.

- large nasal vessel can already be appreciated before start of surgery
- innocuous looking gonioscopic view of vessel https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=116
- bleeding starts immediately after TM removal; unusually, it is barely tamponaded by infusion pressure; a brief attempt at cauterization is made (trabectome pressed with side against sclera, then activated) but without luck
- bleeding continues during initial phaco steps under visco tamponade
- pulsation can be seen during phaco chop with an IOP of 60 mmHg (Alcon Centurion) https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=390
- impresive blancing of entire nasal quadrant indicating very efficient BSS displacing episcleral venous blood https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=423
- pulsation during I&A https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=541
- surgeon compresses vessel to see whether it is truly the source of intracameral bleeding https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=658
- an attempt is made to compress it with 10-0 nylon but the first suture turns out to not have sufficient tension https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=1063
- second tying appears to compress the vessel sufficiently (but the question is whether it will last) with hopes that it will coagulate and close while the remainder of the angle remains ablated and functioning https://youtu.be/8K-ptGkyxlY?t=1273"

advanced POAG in 50 yo AAM
chronic avascular bleb leak failed conservative management (contact lens, aqueous suppressants)
rationale: 
- trabectome will take pressure of leak, refluxed blood will help seal leak
- tube shunt can be safely and completely tied off with chromic gut (2 month before opening)
- Baerveldt tube shunt (BGI 350) will achieve low pressures with few eye drops to help with poor compliance
- bleb repair with second scleral patch pulley that is pulled in using a vicryl suture pulley

Dr. Razeghinejad performs a cataract extraction followed by ab interno bleb revision and external bleb needling. Viscoelastic is injected to keep the eye formed. A spatula is placed from the anterior chamber through the trabeculectomy sclerostomy into the subconjunctival space. The I/A handpiece is used to pressurize the anterior chamber, which demonstrates that the bleb is still encapsulated. Bleb needling is then performed to break the subconjunctival adhesions and develop a responsive bleb."

Dr. Pandit performs a pars plana vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane peel for macular pucker. First, 23-gauge trochars are placed, and a core vitrectomy is performed. Next, indocyanine green is instilled to stain the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Under high magnification, an ILM flap is created, then the ILM is peeled circumferentially around the macula. Care is taken to minimize the instruments crossing the fovea to avoid phototoxicity or mechanical trauma. Finally, 360-degree scleral depression is performed to identify any retinal breaks, and an air fill is performed."

Dr. Xu performs a pars plana vitrectomy followed by endolaser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for diabetic vitreous hemorrhage. First, three vitrectomy ports are placed 4 mm from the limbus in this phakic patient. Next, a core vitrectomy is carefully performed, avoiding damage to the retina while the view is poor. Once the central vitreous is removed and the retina can be visualized, the peripheral vitreous is removed. Endolaser PRP is applied, followed by scleral depression with additional endolaser. Finally, an air-fluid exchange is performed, then the ports are removed."

This video demonstrates a lower blepharoplasty with fat transposition, in which fat is moved from the eyelid to the midface following release of the orbital retaining ligament. Dr. Watson uses a transconjunctival approach to the inferior orbital rim then opens the septum, which permits development of the fat pedicles for transposition and liposclupting. The periosteum is incised, and a periosteal elevator is used for ligamentous release. The pedicles are then transposed into the developed subperiosteal pockets with a full-thickness quilting-style suture."

This is a tough case of a patient with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's Granulomatosis). He also has a history of high myopia. In his other eye, he has a history of retinal detachment requiring scleral buckle and tube shunt implantation for refractory glaucoma. Over time, both of these developed recurrent erosion/exposure, leaving him essentially monocular. He was referred with medically-uncontrolled glaucoma in his better-seeing eye. Given his prior history, we opted to try a canal-based procedure to avoid the issues of erosion. We chose Ab Interno Canaloplasty since he was monocular, as we wanted to reduce the risk of hyphema.

Vision had dropped from 20/25 to 20/100.
A extensive subepithelial, well defined, white calcific plaque was seen overlying the central cornea.
there was no active inflammation, but corneal tomography revealed marked stromal thining in association with the calcified plaque causing decreased vision and photophobia.

We managed this patient with a triple procedure including:
- K2EDTA subepithelial scraping to remove Bowman and anterior stroma calcium deposits
- amniotic membrane transplant to improve stromal thickness and prevent recorrent epithelial erosion
- lastly due to persistent photophobia the ICRS were explanted

Symptoms and vision improved, but final refractive status will require at least 3 months of follow-up

The patient underwent phacoemulsification eye surgery with multifocal IOL implant more than five years ago. 

On a routine visit, the patient complained of decreased visual acuity, which was found to be due to a decentered IOL inner difractive ring.
Diffractive MIOLs are very sensitive to decentration, so the only possible solution was to try to re-center the IOL.
We present our technique which allowed a successfulr ecovery of distance and near visual acuity.

During surgery superior zonular dialysis occurred and the IOL was placed in the sulcus. However a residual cortical material remained on the bag causing severe contraction and fibrosis leading to reduced vision 1 month after phacoemulsification
In this video we describe our surgical approach which we believe provides long term stability:
- Replacing the IOL in the capsular bag, 
- plus cortical cleanup with microforceps 
- anterior vitrectomy

XGLxlYcRhlM,conjunctival;scleral;cataract surgery;,The Cupid for Aphakia - Universal Scleral Fixation Surgical Technique Step-by-Step,"We present The Cupid universal scleral fixation technique for aphakia with no capsular support!

Many techniques have been described in the last few years from implanting an intraocular lens with no capsular support. However most of these techniques require either a specific type of IOL such as ""iris-claw"" or 3 piece IOLs with thin haptics and also specific instrumentation.

The Cupid for aphakia requires only:
- minicrescent blade
- 25 gauge needle
- double armed 9-0 prolene on straight needles (STC-6)

The main advantages of this technique are:
1. The surgeon can use any model of IOL, it is particularly easy with IOLs with loop haptics but any model can be used (the surgeon may pierce the optic or the haptic junction prior to implantation)
2. it requires no conjunctival dissection or scleral flap creation

Comparing to Yamane intrascleral haptic fixation the surgeon is not restricted to 3 piece IOLs, which are prone to haptic disengagment due to the surgical maneuvres and possibly long term subluxation. There is also the possibility that the haptic flanges become exteriorized increasing the risk of late infection

Please feel free to comment on your favorite surgical technique for aphakia with no capsular support

Phacoemulsification was performed targeting a slight myopic residual (-0.75 to -1.00D) however the 2 week postoperative refraction was -2.25D.

To correct this myopic error an intraocualr lens exchange was performed
The first implanted IOL was a Rayone monofocal, this is a monobloc lens with closed loop haptics, having an overall diameter of 12.5 mm and a 6 mm optic!

The pacman technique was performed, consisting of cutting a slice of the IOL optic and then rotating it through a 2.4 mm corneal incision

Thsi procedure was done under topical anesthesia

We present our combined phaco-trabeculectomy step by step surgical technique, in a case with advanced pseudoexfoliative glaucoma and cataract!
Despite the progress of MIGS implants, trabeculectomy is still considered the standard of care for advanced glaucoma. In this case, preoperative IOP was 28 mmHg IOP with brinzolamide, brimonidine, timolol and bimatoprost and there was significant optic disk cupping as well as advanced cataract.
Phaco was performed with a monofocal preloaded IOL in the bag, followed by ab externo trabeculectomy with mitomycin C.
We believe that a methodical approach to trabeculectomy leads to good clinical outcomes and is the reason this technique is still so valuable in todays practice.
We achieved a sustained decrease in IOP with no topical medication whatsoever and a significant vision improvement!

This ingenious intraocular implant was devised by Dr. Claudio Trindade to treat irregular corneal astigmatism and higher-order aberrations from corneal ectasia or corneal scarring/opacities, with potential for improving both distance and near uncorrected vision.

We preformed this implant in a patient with cataract and residual corneal subepithelial infiltrates following Excimer LASER PTK treatment. The patient had myopic shift and residual opacities causing mdoerate increase in irregualr astigmatism and higher-order aberrations.
In this video we detail the cataract surgery phacoemulsification technique and the Xtrafocus pinhole implantation.

The patient had an outstanding recovery achieving uncorrected funtional distance and near visual acuities
This implant is a promising therapeutic solution from cases with corneal pathology causing irregular astigmatism.

Apparently the patient had underwent phakic toric iris-claw IOL (Artiflex) more than 2 years before, then LASIK and PRK  a few months later to improve residual error, and one year later the attending surgeon decided to exchange the phakic IOL, which resulted in Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.

Due to unresolving symptoms and a persisting fixed dialted pupil. The patient was referred for pupilloplasty. 

to perform the pupil reconstruction we ahd to explant the iris-claw IOL in place and exchange for a newly calculated IOL

We describe the technique for pupilloplasty using siepser sliding knot, and the correct sequence for toric Artiflex phakic IOL implantation

This corneal transplant technique has been recently surpassed by selective lamellar techniques but it is still a fundamental vision restoring surgery in cases of severe corneal ectasia (keratoconus, keratoglobus, pellucid marignal degeneration) or deep stromal opacities from infectious or traumatic corneal lesions.

This patient had advanced keratoconus (grade 3 RETICS) with significant stromal thinning as well as subepithelial infiltrates from previous adenoviral keratitis. 
Both conditions led to a best visual acuity of 20/100. 
Penetrating keratoplasty was the only technqiue that could relaibly correct both corneal conditions

The patient was planned for iris-claw phakic IOL due to high myopia, but an accidental grasp on the iris resulted in a severe iridodialysis of about 12 clock hours extension.
After controlling the IOP and hyphema the patient was referred to us for iris reconstruction surgery, including:

- the creation of 3 scleral fixation points for the detached iris root
- pupilloplasty of the teared iris sphincter

the technique was performed using only a minicrescent blade for scleral dissection and 10-0 prolene sutures on straight needles.
The needles were carefully passed over the crystalline lens avoiding any contact with the anterior capsule! 
the patient successfully ahd her vision restored to pre-operative level.

Additionally we present anteriro segment fluorescein angiography for a case we previously presented which now has more than 5 years of follow-up

Interestingly despite the extensive iris trauma and vascular filling defects, the tissue remained viable and that patient still achieves 20/20 visual acuity and intraocular pressure is in normal range with no signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy

the patient asked about the possibility of achieving spectacle free vision, however fundus examination revealed an extensive eprietinal membrane in OS

Therefore trifocal diffractive IOL was not recommended, we opted to implant the new extended vision Vivity IOL. It is non diffractive and uses two central transitional elements to achieve an extended range of vision.

we performed 27G Phaco Vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane surgery, assisted with triamcinolone and brillant blue dye to stain the posterior cortical vitreous and the inner limiting membrane.

Uncorrected distance visual acuity improved to 20/30 verified 3 weeks after surgery
Uncorrected near visual acuity is at J3

spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals that foveal morphology is improving and visual acuity will also continue to improve

An 86 year-old man, presented with sudden loss of vision in his right eye due to a subluxated intraocular lens /capsular bag complex in association with pseudoexfoliation syndrome
Preoperative Visual acuity was hand motion
and alongside the subluxated IOL/bag there was vitreous hemorrhage suggesting prior Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema syndrome

The patient is diabetic and hypocoagulated due to cardiac arrythmia
Our goal with the scleral fixation was to: 
- Restore visual acuity
- mantain the IOL and the capsular bag
- no significant corneal or scleral incisions
- minimally invasive surgical instruments & maneuvres

Four scleral Hoffman pockets were created to accomodate the tetrascleral fixation of the four IOL haptics
This technique simply uses:
minicrescent blade to create scleral pocket
10-0 prolene suture on two straight needles
25G guiding needles

To finalize the case, 25G posterior vitrectomy was performed to clear the vitreous hemorrhage and to check the periphery for any signs of retinal tears

Successful IOL centration was achieved and vision improved to 20/40 corrected

This is now our primary minimally invasive glaucoma surgery technique (MIGS), due to its efficacy in reducing intraocualr pressure (IOP) combined with safety and the possibility of being done under subconjunctival anesthesia

As of today we have implanted over 150 XEN stents, and while some cases required re-intervention in the following months, there were no whatsoever cases of serious complications such as choroidal effusion or hemorrhage, bleb leakage or infection which may happen wit the more traditional ab externo trabeculectomy procedure 

Our success rate (cases with significant reduction of intraocular pressure below 20 mmHg with no medication or reduced need of medication) is about 70% which is remarkable for such a safe techninque, minimally invasive

neks0P1pSfM,scleral;cataract surgery;,The Cupid - a scleral fixation technique for repositioning dislocated intraocular lenses,"This video describes The Cupid Scleral Fixation for Dislocated intraocular lenses. The original presentation was at the at the 13th Winter Meeting of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (Rome, Italy, February 2009) and it has been published in the Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery (2011 Sep;37 (9):1571-5). 
The main advantages of this technique are;
1. it preserves the original IOL, allowing recentration with minimal intraocular maneuvres
2. can be used to recenter any type of IOL (it has been applied to silicone and
acrylic material, monoblock, plate and 3-piece designs)
3. the fixation suture can by placed circumferencially at any position in order to ensure best IOL centration

We have been using The Cupid in both private and public health settings, since 2009, now accounting for a little over 200 surgeries for repositioning of dislocated IOLs, and to our knowledge only 18 cases so far required re-intervention to re-center the IOL (mostly cases with severe zonulysis and IOL dislocation requiring 2 Cupid fixation sutures).

In this case, he uses an unflodable single-piece PMMA IOL (SH 70F from Mediphacos). Differently from the 4-flanged technique, in this surgery, scleral flaps are created, and the final flange remains beneath the sclera. Another variation of Canabrava technique (4-flanged intrascleral Iol fixation) utilizes a 4-haptic IOL such as Akreos or Micropure, which offers the theoretical advantage of reducing the risk of IOL tilt. Additionally, using a foldable IOL eliminates the need for large corneal incisions.
However, the presented technique allows for the placement of a unfoldable single-piece PMMA IOL using 5-0 prolene sutures, a material commonly available in most surgical centers. This technique offers a practical advantage as it enables surgeons to use readily accessible resources while achieving successful IOL fixation.",Iol fixation,Canabrava technique,4 flanged,vitrectomy,retina

EsN95__Fe7M,scleral;retinal;,Repair of a retinal detachment associated with Giant retinal tear,"This is a case shared by Dr. Abdallah Zadnass from Agadir - Morocco
In this case, a Pars plana vitrectomy was indicated to treat a pseudophakic patient with retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear in the right eye.
Giant retinal tears is defined as a retinal break larger than 3 clock hours and this condition poses a challenge to vitreoretinal surgeons. First, because of your size, the tear tends to roll back and have radial extensions. A posterior vitreous detachment is normally present, but the vitreous remains attached to the anterior margin of the flap. Then, it’s important perform radical excision removing as much as possible the vitreous base under scleral indentation including the anterior margin of the tear.
Although the role of prophylactic ILM peeling is still controversial in these cases, some surgeons used to do it to prevent postoperative ERM formation.
In some cases it's also important to remove all the fibrosed and folded borders of the flap. Heavy liquids are very useful in these cases once it helps to keep the flap down and to remove all the subretinal fluid. It's important to try to inject perfluor in a single bubble to avoid fish eggs effect and subretinal migration.
It's important to try to inject PFCL in a single bubble. In case of multiple bubbles formation, they have to be aspirated or transformed in a single one, before it reaches the flap margin. This way you can avoid subretinal PFCL migration. 

In this case the surgeon completes the perfluor injection until the margin of the tear, and then, using a soft tip cannula the margin was unrolled, and the residual subretinal fluid was aspirated.
After aspiration of the fluid, the perfluor bubble is completed to the periphery to perform the endolaser around the retinal tear.

A thorough and careful removal of all the residual subretinal fluid it's important to prevent retinal slippage during the Fluid air exchange. 

At the end of the surgery, silicone oil was chosen as the tamponade agent in this procedure.

XHuVXlPaMK0,anterior chamber paracentesis;pars plana vitrectomy;,Iris Claw IOL fixation of an Artisan®,"This is a case shared by Dr. Masoud Mirghorbani from Tehran, Iran
In this video we show the technique for secondary IOL implant of a retropupillary Artisan.
In this case, pars plana vitrectomy was indicated to remove a dislocated IOL. Secondary IOL implantation of a retropupillary Artisan® was programmed for the same procedure.After placing the sclerotomies, it is possible to see the IOL and capsular support dropped into the vitreous cavity.Vitreous core are performed and triamcinolone was used to help PVD induction maneuver.Then, a perfluorocarbon liquid bubble is placed in the posterior pole to avoid macular trauma related to the dislocated IOL. The vitreous base is shaved and the complex IOL and capsular support is dragged to the anterior chamber and removed through a corneal incision.
The Artisan®  is a single-piece, non foldable, PMMA IOL that has an enclavation system. It is possible to implant this IOL in front or behind the pupil. Special forceps to hold the IOL and to perform the enclavation is necessary for this technique. 
First, anterior chamber paracentesis are made at 2 and 10 o'clock. Then a miotic agent can be used to close the pupil, and a 5.5mm limbal or sclerocorneal incision is made at 12 o'clock.For retropupillary implantation, it is important to place the IOL ""upside down"" so that the haptics are oriented upwards.
So the Artisan is implanted and rotated to the position where the iris enclavation will be made.The surgeon uses an Artisan implantation forceps to grasp the IOL and place the first side in the retropuppilary plane. Then he moves the IOL upward against the iris to facilitate the enclavation. The enclavation forceps is pushed against the iris and the claw to clip the IOL.The same steps are repeated on the other side. 
At the end of the surgery 10-0 Nylon corneal sutures are made, perfluor is removed and the vitreous base is checked.

3HPq5pfAiMA,conjunctival;scleral;iridoplasty;retinal;,IOL scleral fixation: Akreos & GoreTex - Step by Step,"In this video we will show the step by step of a 4-point scleral fixation technique using the Akreos IOL and GoreTex sutures.
 
One of the key points for a good result of this technique is to correctly position the 4 fixation points. So the surgery begins with conjunctival peritomy in two diametrically opposite points, cauterization of the scleral vessels and marking with a pen the fixation sites. 

The points should be marked 3mm from the limbus and 4 or 5mm apart on each side. In this procedure, a linear incision is made with a crescent blade, 4mm from the limbus. Then the crescent is used to make a scleral groove that passes under the 2 fixation points.
The purpose of the groove is to leave the thread and suture in the intrascleral space at the end of the surgery and avoid complications such as suture extrusion in the future. 

Note that the groove must laterally extend beyond the previously marked fixing points. The same steps made on one side are then performed at points located 180º apart from the first one. 
Also note that these steps are done even before the placement of the vitrectomy infusion line.
In this case, the patient had already undergone vitrectomy to remove
a dislocated IOL to the vitreous, and to treat a temporal retinal detachment.
The superior cannulas are placed at the superior points marked previously for fixation, and it serves as access to endoillumination and vitrectomy probe, for vitreous base review or other necessary procedures.  
After vitrectomy, a corneal incision must be made perpendicular to the axis of the fixation points. 
It is important to make an incision of at least 3 mm so that the Akreos can be folded and easily inserted through the corneal incision. 
The CV-8 GoreTex is cut in half and its needles are removed. 
One of the halves is then placed on a 30 - G needle for insertion through one of the inferior fixation points. Then it is grasped with forceps through the corneal incision.
Next, the Akreos IOL is opened and the GoreTex is passed through 2 haptics on one of its sides. Then, the same suture is inserted again through the cornea incision and it is grasped through the superior sclerotomy on that side using a retinal forceps.
The other half of the GoreTex is then used to fix the other 2 Akreos haptics. It is very important, in these steps, to take care not to cross the sutures on one side with the other. 
The insertion of the already sutured IOL was done with the help of a McPherson and a Chopper forceps. The IOL should be folded exactly in half, and implanted through the corneal incision.
After insertion, the surgeon must carefully pull the GoreTex wires from
each side to promote centralization of the Akreos. 
The trocars are carefully removed so as not to lose the suture threads. 
Using a hook, or a Lester forceps, the sutures are pulled under the scleral groove performed at the beginning of the surgery. 
This way the final GoreTex knot will be placed in the intrascleral space. 
Finally, the surgeon should check the IOL position before tying the GoreTex sutures. The sutures are closed in a classic 3-1-1 pattern, or like in this case, with Slipknot technique. 
It is important to avoid decentralization of the IOL while tying the knot of the first side. You can suture bilaterally first, adjust the IOL position, and then finally close the knots.
At the end of the surgery, after cutting the excess GoreTex, the knot is buried into the superior sclerotomy and the sutures are kept inside the scleral sulcus bilaterally. 

In this case, an iridoplasty was also performed to correct an area of
superior iris defect. For this procedure, 10-0 Prolene sutures were used.

Finally, 10-0 Nylon was used for corneal sutures, and 7-0 Vycril sutures was used to close the conjunctiva. This Scleral fixation technique allows for good centralization of the IOL and decreases the risk of sutures breakage and IOL dislocation, as sometimes happens in the long term in techniques using Prolene sutures.

This is a case of a 79 years old female patient, who complained of sudden worsening in vision in the left eye last week. 
Her BCVA was 20/200 in the left eye and the fundoscopy showed a dense vitreous hemorrhage.The B scan ultrasonography evidenced a echolucent nasal lesion that has dome-shaped form. It was possible to see the presence of a clot ""retraction cleft"" that separates the subretinal clot from the underlying choroid. 
This feature is useful to differentiate the lesion from ocular melanoma. 
Once the vitreous hemorrhage was dense and occurred in the best patient's eye, pars plana vitrectomy was indicated.

So, after the vitreous core removal it was possible to see an inferonasal lesion with subretinal hemorrhage in the periphery. Differently from this case, Peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy lesions occur in the most cases in the inferotemporal quadrant. 
As follows, the posterior vitreous detachment was checked and then the vitreous base was shaved using a scleral depressor. 
In this procedure the surgeon didn't make scleral depression in the nasal quadrant over the lesion to avoid new hemorrhagic events.
Endolaser was made around the hemorrhagic lesion and over the area of the clot.
Fluid air exchange was not made, and no tamponade agent was used.
Peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy is most frequent in women greater than 65 years old.The location of appearance is most frequent in the inferotemporal periphery and it is bilateral in 33% of cases.The most feared missed differential for these lesions is choroidal melanoma and the preoperative ocular US is useful to differentiate the lesions.

UulxM9u9wpE,scleral;phacoemulsification;retinal;,Intraoperative choroidal detachment management during vitrectomy,"In this video we discuss the management of intraoperative choroidal detachment during vitrectomy

This is a case of a 72 years old male patient, with a history of  diabetic retinopathy and previous branch retinal vein occlusion in his left eye.

He complained of worsening vision in both eyes in the last months. His BCVA was 20/200 in both eyes. In the fundoscopy patient had signs of recent CRVO in OD and vitreous hemorrhage associated with new vessels and macular traction in the left eye.

For the treatment of the left eye a combined phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy was indicated.
So, after phaco and IOL implant, the surgeon places the 23 gauge trocars for the vitrectomy. 
In the first sclerotomy, the surgeon places the inferotemporal trocar for the infusion line using uniplanar incision technique. Note, however, that the position of the trocar is more inclined than usual.
After checking the position in the pars plana,the surgeon turns the infusion on and starts the vitrectomy.

In the beginning of the core vitrectomy, the anterior vitreous is removed behind the IOL without the BIOM system.
Then, the surgeon disconnects the peripheral vitreous from the vitreous still attached to the vascular arcades to avoid further traction in the macular region.
PVD maneuver is made to ensure posterior hyaloid detachment, and then, the vitreous base is removed using scleral depressor.

Panretinal photocoagulation is made in all quadrants including the extreme periphery.

Once vitreoschisis areas are common in cases of diabetic retinopathy with macular traction, the surgeon stains the macula with brilliant blue dye looking for areas of epiretinal membranes. The area of ERM normally appears as a negative stain in contrast to the blue of stained internal limiting membrane. 

At the end of the procedure, the surgeon checks the anterior chamber and then enters the eye again to review the vitreous base. However, a 360º choroidal detachment is present. It happened because a partial retraction of the infusion line probably occurred during the scleral depression. The more inclined insertion of this trocar in the beginning of the surgery may have facilitated the retraction of the infusion as well.  

To manage the choroidal detachment, the surgeon removed the infusion line from the pars plana and inserted it into the anterior chamber, increasing temporally the IOP to 60 mmHg. 

After a few minutes the choroidal detachment was reduced, the infusion line was placed in the pars plana again and finally the vitreous base was checked.

So, to avoid intraoperative choroidal detachment:

- be careful with the sclerotomy angulation
- use a drape to secure the infusion tubing
- Be careful with your movements during scleral indentation to avoid unintentional displacement of the infusion cannula

To manage intraoperative choroidal detachment:

- First, keep calm and examine the globe to check the infusion cannula
- Change the infusion position to another trocar, in an area without choroidal detachment, or to the anterior chamber
- Increase the IOP temporally and monitor choroidal detachment resolution

trAyFLaMf5U,scleral;retinal;,Tips on: Shaving peripheral vitreous,"In this video we discuss a tip to improve visualization for shaving peripheral vitreous with scleral depression.

New technologies like wide-angle viewing systems, high-speed vitreous cutters, small-incision trocar systems and chandelier lighting, enable surgeons to perform a thorough vitrectomy, which is crucial for the treatment of many vitreoretinal pathologies. 

Sometimes, however, the surgeon can find difficulties to adequately visualize the peripheral vitreous, even with the use of these technologies. 

In this case, a patient with Proliferative diabetic retinopathy associated with macular traction was submitted to pars plana vitrectomy. After removing all the membranes from the vascular arcades and from the optic disc, a permanent haze associated with bleeding coming from the neovascularization of the optic disc worsened the surgeon's visualization. Endocautery was used in the retinal bleeding points, and the intraocular pressure was temporally increased, but the bleeding in the papila remained.

Even with the use of a Chandelier Light the surgeon didn't have adequate peripheral visualization to shave the vitreous base. 

To improve the contrast and enable better visualization of the peripheral vitreous, you can use trans-scleral illumination at the point of indentation. 
Some surgeons use the endoilluminator probe itself to gently depress the sclera. However, the blunt tip of the scleral depressor allows a more effective and controlled indentation. So, you can hold both instruments, the scleral depressor and the endoillumination probe together to perform trans-scleral illumination and allow a safetier peripheral shaving of the vitreous base.
This technique, however, does not allow the surgeon to slide the scleral depressor how we used to do when using only this instrument. To change the position, you need first to move the scleral depressor and then positioning the endoilluminator probe in the same place. 
It is a simple tip that you can use in several vitrectomy procedures when you are not comfortable with the illumination of the vitreous base.

xWyJSr3K1Cw,scleral;anterior chamber paracentesis;retinal;muscle;,Chandelier assisted Scleral Buckling procedure,"This is a case shared by Dr. Aissani Frederic from Bejaia, Algeria

This is a case of a 57 years old male patient who presents a macula off retinal detachment in the right eye for about one week. In fundoscopy, patients presented a single break at 12 o'clock and the surgeon programmed scleral buckling assisted by chandelier light to treat this patient.

So first, a 360º peritomy was made and the rectus muscles were hooked using silk sutures. Then, a chandelier light is placed  inferiorly on the opposite side of the break.

By using a chandelier light, you are able to improve visualization of the retinal detachment area, and in this step you are able to perform scleral indentation and to make cryopexy over the break. 

In this case, the cryopexy was not performed. The tear was marked and its position is located under the superior rectus muscle. The surgeon used a cautery to control the bleeding and also to help mark the correct positioning of the sutures of the buckle.

Instead of circumferential buckling, in this case the surgeon used a 5mm sponge for longitudinal indentation. The mattress sutures were placed 7mm apart and about 3mm behind the rectus muscle insertion to cover the area of the break. Then the subretinal fluid was drained before placing the buckle, using the 8-0 vicryll needle. It's important to make the drainage in the pre equatorial region, near the horizontal muscles and far from the vortex veins. This way you are able to slowly drain the subretinal fluid and to avoid complications like retinal incarceration.

After placing the sponge, the surgeon is able to check the indentation area using the Chandelier light and the wide field viewing system. It was possible to see a residual subretinal fluid, but the buckle indentation covers all the retinal break area. 
The ends of the sponge were shortened and sutured and the surgeon made a massage in the drainage area to complete subretinal fluid removal.
Checking it again, it was possible to see that all the subretinal fluid was gone and the sponge created a good indentation in the superior periphery.
So the surgeon performed sutures in the 25 gauge chandelier incision with Vicryl sutures, made an anterior chamber paracentesis with 30 gauge needle and injected 0.5ml of SF6 gas into the vitreous cavity.

The cryopexy was not done in this case, but if necessary, photocoagulation around the break, can be performed during postoperative follow-up. The patient had a good outcome improving the visual acuity to 20/50 postoperatively. 

Chandelier light is an excellent tool and can help the intraoperatively visualization of all the breaks, allows a controlled cryopexy, and helps to check about satisfactory indentation area in scleral buckling procedures.

r6hqR8vDiTs,scleral;retinal;,Management for retinal detachment associated with Giant Retinal Tear,"In this video shared by Dr. Francyne Veiga from Ribeirão Preto - Brazil, we highlight some key points on vitrectomy secondary to Giant retinal tear cases. 

After core vitrectomy, it is important to remove all the condensed vitreous along the anterior edge 360º with scleral depression. The anterior flap of the GRT needs to be trimmed also, to prevent peripheral ischemia, PVR and traction.Remove the folded and fibrosed border of the retinal flap. You can use an endodiathermy to avoid unnecessary bleeding in this step.
After gently repositioning the retinal flap, the PFCL is gradually injected over the optic disc with displacement of the subretinal fluid anteriorly.
Be careful about the jet stream during PFCL injection because of the risk of migration of the heavy liquid to the subretinal space. In this case, the surgeon had to make two retinotomies to remove the Perfluor bubbles before continuing the surgery.
After endolaser around the tear, another key point in these cases is the Fluid air exchange. 
It is really important to carefully remove all the subretinal fluid to avoid retinal slippage. You can start removing perfluor until it is just posterior to the edge of the tear. Then you thoroughly remove the BSS, keeping your aspiration on the interface of it with the PFCL. You can help the subretinal fluid removal by turning the eye away from the tear while aspirating the remaining BSS. Alternatively, direct fluid against silicone oil exchange can be performed.

hVIE4uzUeSE,scleral;retinal;,Lens sparing vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,"This is a video shared by Dr. Aissani Frederic from Bejaia, Algeria. 
 
Once manipulations at the vitreous base are significantly harder to perform in phakic patients, we must take some special care to avoid lens touch during lens sparing vitrectomies
 
This is a case of a 59-year-old male patient, with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment involving macula, in his right eye and a single break inferotemporal.
 
In this case, vitrectomy was performed sparing the crystalline lens.
 
So, at first, you need to place the trocars at 4mm from the limbus in phakic eyes. During all vitrectomy, it is important to keep the instruments away from the lens and avoid as much as possible to cross the vitrector or illumination probe toward the contralateral meridian.
In this case, after PVD induction, the surgeon used PFCL to flatten the retina and to condensate the peripheral vitreous.
Triamcinolone was used to stain the peripheral vitreous and to facilitate the shaving. 
 
Vitreous base excision is made using mild scleral indentation, behind the ora serrata and with low infusion to avoid trauma in the crystalline lens.
Movements that make the intorsion, or extortion of the globe, can help to better access the periphery of the retina, without touching the lens
 
The tear is marked with a 25- gauge endodiathermy before the fluid air exchange. This is important especially in cases of small round breaks or in myopic fundus in which it is easier to miss the tear position because of the worse visualization with the gas interface.
 
After completing the FAX, retinopexy was made with the cryo probe, and in the end of the procedure, 20% SF6 gas was chosen as tamponade.

This patient had a good outcome with the retina attached after the surgery, and with BCVA of 60/100.

XIzHleJDiH0,conjunctival;scleral;lensectomy;iridotomy;retinal;,Vitrectomy and Buckle for Giant Retinal Tear,"This is a case share by Dr. David Cordeiro Sousa from Melbourne Australia
This is a case of a 27 year old male with a history of worsening in the visual acuity in the Right Eye 10 days ago.His BCVA on the presentation was count finger in the right eye and 6/12 in the left eye, the IOP was 3mmHg in OD. In the slit lamp examination he had a superotemporally subluxated white cataract in both eyes.The fundus examination in the OD was difficult because of medium opacities but it was possible to see a retinal detachment associated with GRT with macula involved. The B-scan US OD evidenced a retinal detachment associated with choroidal effusion.
In the beginning of the surgery, we can notice that the lens was very mobile. The surgeon started the procedure performing a lensectomy using an anterior chamber maintainer, due to the choroidal effusion.
During the vitrectomy it was possible to see a total retinal detachment associated with a GRT superotemporally. The retina was very mobile with anterior folds and ciliary body detachment. In these cases it is important to be careful during trimming of the vitreous base, to avoid iatrogenic breaks. Using a scleral depressor, the surgeon is able to safely remove the vitreous from the base using parameters with high cut rates and low vacuum. It is also important to remove the anterior flap of the Giant retinal tear in these cases. Brilliant blue dye was used to stain the ILM and to ensure that there weren't areas of remnant posterior hyaloid still attached.  
After finishing the shaving of the base, the surgeon decided to place an encircling band. So, a circumferential conjunctival peritomy was made, the muscles were isolated and then the infusion line was changed to the pars plana. A 240 scleral band was placed then 6mm behind the insertion of the muscles using scleral tunnel technique. The advantage of this technique is that you are able to place a buckle without using mersilene sutures, usually faster than the sutured technique. However, one has to take care about the width of the incision created by the crescent blade to prevent scleral perforation. After passing the buckle into the four sulcus in all quadrants and behind the muscles, the band is tidy using a standard sleeve. As following, perfluorocarbon liquid was used to flat the retina, and endolaser was made circumferentially around the area of the giant retina tear, and of the scleral indentation.
The FAX was made without retinal slippage, and we can see better under air an area of choroidal detachment temporally. Before Fax, the surgeon performed an inferior iridotomy . The buckle indentation was tightened under air and silicone oil was implanted at the end of the vitrectomy. So,  the trocars were removed, the silicone oil bubbles washed and then scleroconjunctival sutures were made.The patient improved visual acuity after 1 month to 6/30 and this is the aspect of the retina in the month 3.

YaStfTpaNBQ,conjunctival;phacoemulsification;retinal;,Tips on Endophthalmitis,"This is a case shared by Dr. Thiago Siqueira from Niterói Brazil

This is a 45 year old female patient, submitted to phacoemulsification in the left eye. In the second day postoperatively she had worsening in the visual acuity associated with conjunctival hyperemia and hypopyon. For the treatment, on the same day a broad spectrum antibiotic injection was made. Since, the patient didn´t have clinical improvement of the inflammation and vitreits, pars plana vitrectomy and new antibiotic injection was programmed.
In cases of endophthalmitis, it is important to take a sample from the core vitreous before turning the infusion on. So, you can first place the cannulas and position the infusion line, but  keep it off. If you weren't able to see the infusion cannula on the pars plana, consider placing an anterior chamber maintainer. 
Then connect a 3ml syringe to the aspiration path of your vitrector and keep the mouth of the probe in the central vitreous with high cut rates. In the meantime, your assistant gently aspirates manually  the undiluted vitreous sample. 
The material is then immediately sent to the laboratory for Gram and Giemsa stain, as well as cultures on blood agar, chocolate agar, brain-heart infusion, Sabouraud's media and thioglycolate broth.
Here we can see that the surgeon aspirates a small sample of the central vitreous in the puppilary plane, with the pars plana infusion still turned off. Then, he changes the position of the infusion line to the anterior chamber, since it was not possible to check its position in the pars plana.

In these cases, sometimes, the poor visualization will allow only the safety removal of the core vitreous. In the beginning, try to remove the anterior vitreous holding the probe at the pupillary plane avoiding excessive movement As soon as you are able to see better the retinal vessels, try to move posteriorly your probe, and with possible, detach carefully the posterior hyaloid. PVD induction and removal of epiretinal membranes are the most difficult steps in endophthalmitis surgery because sometimes the retina is very fragile and easy to induce retinal breaks. Avoid aggressive removal of all infiltrated vitreous in the basal area. 

If possible, try to remove the remaining inflammatory debris in the anterior chamber and capsular bag. In some cases the IOL and capsular complex removal can be considered. 
In this case, once retinal breaks did not occur, silicone oil was not used as tamponade.
The procedure is completed by closing all incisions in a watertight manner and injecting broad-spectrum intraocular antibiotics.

2i4yo4XH3DM,scleral;retinal;,Epiretinal membrane after ocular trauma,"This is a video shared by Dr. Nassim Abreu from Santo Domingo – Dominican Republic

This is a 24-year-old male patient with history of a penetrant ocular trauma in his left eye, with a knife, 2 months ago. In the primary surgery lens was aspirated and corneal e scleral sutures were made to stabilize the globe. After 2 months patient was submitted to the second procedure to remove a fibrotic tissue from the macular region.
So, pars plana vitrectomy was made and brilliant blue dye was used to peel the dense epiretinal membrane and the internal limiting membrane in block.
In these cases, it’s important to remove carefully the dense fibrotic tissue above fovea to avoid excessive traction and iatrogenic macular hole. For the peeling, you can remove the membranes around the perifoveal zone by using tangential traction. 

A Tano scraper or a Finesse Flex loop can be used as adjuvant to the retinal forceps to create flaps, lift the membranes and facilitate the peeling.
In the end of the surgery fluid air exchange was made and once it wasn’t retinal breaks in the periphery, silicone oil or gas injection wasn’t necessary in this case.

brY9zB6NLEQ,scleral;phacoemulsification;pars plana vitrectomy;,Vitrectomy for removal of dislocated nucleus,"This is a video of an 81-year-old male patient with best corrected visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and with a hard nuclear cataract.

He underwent phacoemulsification, and even trying to make a capsulorhexis a little wider, and doing the hydrodissection very carefully, during the surgery, a change in the pattern of the anterior chamber was noticed and subluxation of the lens complex and capsular support to the vitreous cavity was noticed.
The surgery was then converted to pars plana vitrectomy with a 23g non-valved cannula system, using Chandelier as accessory illumination. 
There are two techniques for removing the dislocated lens into the vitreous cavity. One option is to use the vitrectomy system's fragmatome, and the other is levitating the dislocated nucleus with perfluorocarbon for direct removal through an enlarged sclerocorneal incision, or for removal via the anterior chamber using the phaco probe.
As it was a hard cataract, the second option was chosen in this case.
At the beginning of this surgery, it is important to perform anterior vitrectomy to remove the peripupillary vitreous and around the sclerotomies and the nucleus itself. 
Fragments of the lens, when dislocated to the vitreous cavity, make the posterior hyaloid detachment maneuver more difficult.  
Then, even before completing the dislocation of the lens to the vitreous, detachment of the posterior vitreous was checked. Afterwards, the PFCL was injected into the vitreous cavity to protect the macula.
The lens was then completely dislocated to the vitreous cavity, the vitreous base was shaved under scleral indentation and finally the perfluor was injected to fill the entire vitreous cavity and levitate the nucleus to the peripupillary region.
Since non-valved cannulas were used in this case, plugs were placed to prevent excessive turbulence of the lens and prevent loss of perfluor. 
In this technique, then, the scleral depressor is used to direct the nucleus to the center, and the lens is removed through phacoemulsification at the pupil level.
If possible, it is important to use parameters that allow the removal of the nucleus without breaking them into several fragments, as these would fall into the vitreous cavity and make the surgery longer and hard-working.
At the end of the surgery, a review of the vitreous base is performed, endolaser in iatrogenic breaks or areas of degeneration, and the perfluor is then removed. In this case, due to the loss of capsular support, the secondary implant with intraocular lens fixation was scheduled for a second procedure.

9yGkoYtb6yA,scleral;retinal;,Giant Retinal Tear - To buckle or not to buckle,"This is a case shared by Dr. Melvin Gutiérrez and Dr. Santiago Morales from Barranquilla Colombia
 
This is a case of Giant Retinal Tear treated with Scleral Buckling and combined  phaco/vitrectomy
 
It was a superior retinal detachment with attached macula in the right eye in a young patient.
 
To place a Scleral Buckle or not in cases of Giant retinal tear is still a controversial topic. Studies have shown similar postoperative complications, functional or anatomical success rates with both approaches. However, some surgeons prefer to add a SB once it can support the vitreous base, reduce the circumference of the globe and relieve the vitreoretinal traction in the periphery. Furthermore, it can provide an easier shaving of the vitreous base especially in phakic eyes. 
It's important to be aware that SB can increase the chance of retinal slippage if it is sutured too tight. It occurs due to a change in ocular contour and scleral shortening relative to retina gaping of retinal tissue. 

Heavy liquids are very useful in these cases once it  keeps the retinal flap down and helps to remove all the subretinal fluid.
 
It’s important to perform radical excision, removing as much as possible the vitreous base and also the anterior flap, under scleral indentation.

Another key point of this surgery is to remove all the fibrosed and folded border of the retinal flap. 

Then, endolaser is made around the tear.

During fluid-air exchange, you can avoid slippage by thoroughly removing the subretinal fluid before PFCL aspiration. Tilt the eye away from the tear while aspirating the subretinal fluid and when the tear is completely dry, you can remove the remaining PFCL.

MR9k5ruzEfE,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Complicated cataract surgery: Explanting two IOLs,"This is a video shared by Dr. Prashant Kumar from New Delhi – India
 
In this video, the surgeon shows a pars plana vitrectomy performed to remove two IOLs dislocated to the vitreous cavity after complicated cataract surgery. After placing the trocars, and before starting core vitrectomy, it is important to perform anterior vitrectomy to remove all the vitreous from the pupillary plane.
 In this case, there wasn't adequate capsular support to implant or reposition the IOL in the ciliary sulcus. So the surgeon decided only to remove both dislocated IOL and to program a secondary implant in another procedure. 
In the beginning of the vitrectomy, the core vitreous and areas of vitreous hemorrhage are removed, and triamcinolone was used to help in the PVD induction maneuver. 
All the vitreous is removed from the IOL body, and before dragging the IOL to the anterior chamber, the vitreous base needs to be shaved to avoid iatrogenic retinal breaks.

After removing the vitreous, the surgeon uses two retinal forceps to bring the IOL anteriorly and remove by an enlarged corneal incision. If an IOL is implanted in the ciliary sulcus and another one is still in the vitreous cavity, it will be more difficult for the retinal surgeon to remove the dropped IOL since the anterior chamber removal technique will be unavailable. A large scleral tunnel with greater risks related to hypotony would have been necessary if the IOL had been in the sulcus. Therefore, in cases of complicated cataract surgery, with the IOL dislocated to the vitreous cavity, do not try to place a second IOL in the same procedure.
In this case, once both IOLs were in the vitreous cavity the surgeon could remove it through the anterior chamber. 
In the end of the surgery, nylon sutures are made in the corneal incision. Then fluid air exchange and sclerotomies sutures are performed.

Bglnm8ZQfNU,conjunctival;scleral;retinal;,Tips on primary vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,"This is a pseudophakic patient and therefore sclerotomies were performed 3 mm from the limbus. It is important to make a conjunctival displacement with a forceps or with the trocar tip before the incision. The trocar is then positioned in an angled manner and sclerotomy is made in beveled and uniplanar incision. 
For the infusion placement, first, it's necessary to ensure that the infusion line is fluid-filled. Then, interrupt the flow and connect the line on the inferotemporal cannula and ensure that it is properly secured. Verify if the cannula tip is in the correct position in the vitreous cavity with endoillumination light pipe, or with a forceps acting as mirror, and only after checking, turn on the infusion. In this case, the Chandelier light was used to promote better visualization and greater independence for the surgeon. The superior sclerotomies were made in a bimanual technique in which one hand helps to hold the eye while the contralateral incision is made. 
Non contact viewing system allows also more independence for the surgeon, and it is possible to get good visualization from the posterior pole and periphery with the same lens. Before starting the vitrectomy the surgeon moves the BIOM wheel down to set the focus on the optic disc. Then, the microscope body is moved down to enhance the visual field. In the beginning of the PPV, the anterior vitreous behind the IOL and near the trocars are removed. The core vitreous is then aspirated using diffuse illumination and high cut rates. In this step you can aspirate the subretinal fluid with the cutter on through the break to facilitate the PVD maneuver in the next step. If possible, remove the flap from the break. 
PVD induction is an important step in all vitrectomy cases. In this case the patient had already the vitreous detached. Even though the PVD maneuver was made to ensure the detachment. So the vitrectomy probe is placed in the nasal side of the disc and the vacuum is enhanced while the probe is moved to the mid periphery and anteriorly. If necessary, adjuncts like Triamcinolone can be used in this step.
For reattaching the retina, heavy liquids can be an important tool once it allows to stabilize the posterior retina, and condenses the remaining vitreous in the periphery facilitating the vitreous shaving. It is important to inject PFCL in a single bubble to avoid migration to subretinal space. You can avoid injecting under pressure by reducing the IOP, inject PFCL while aspirating with the cutter on the other hand, or by using proper cannulas like Dual bore.
The vitreous base is made under scleral indentation and with high cut rates and low vacuum. It's important to avoid iatrogenic breaks by keeping the vitrectomy cutter above the area of indentation. You can also turn the mouth of the vitrector alway from the periphery to reduce the risk of engaging retinal tissue. The vitreous shaving is more efficient when removal is performed from posterior to anterior. If you were using non-valved cannulas, remember to use plugs during scleral indentation to avoid hypotony and loss of PFCL.After finishing the vitreous base, the eye is filled with PFCL to remove the remnant subretinal fluid and reattach the retina. During injection, it's important to tilt the eye away from the break so the SRF will be slowly pushed through it. This way you can avoid trapped SRF in the periphery that will eventually slip posteriorly during the FAX.
Endolaser was made in the periphery only around the area of the break superiorly, and around the lattice degeneration inferiorly. Endolaser performed 360º in the periphery is still a controversial point, and usually not indicated for all cases. 
Unlike the injection of PFCL, during the FAX the eye must be tilted in the direction of the break. In this way, the surgeon will be able to remove all the fluid around the perfluor area, and from the subretinal space, while the gas enters into the eye through the infusion line. Only after BSS removal, the vitrector is moved into the PFCL bubble. Be careful about the possibility of traumatic neuropathy related to optic disc touch. Use a soft tip cannula to aspirate the residual PFCL avoiding direct aspiration above the optic disc. After FAX, remember to check all the periphery and complete laser if necessary.
Check about air leakage before implanting the tamponade agent. If any evidence of leakage, after removing the cannulas, suture the sclerotomies with Vycril 7.0.
In this case SF6 gas in a non-expanding concentration of 20% was chosen as a tamponade agent. The infusion line are closed, and the syringe with the gas, prepared in the correct concentration is attached in it. Then a 30-gauge needle is placed as a vent to air-gas exchange. In the end, the vent is removed and the eye tonus is checked before removing the last cannula.

9siCsyenV_w,cataract surgery;retinal;,Iris suture IOL fixation,"This is a video shared by Dra. Fabiana Gonçalves from Recife - Brazil

In this case a 3-pieces IOL was dislocated to the vitreous cavity after complicated cataract surgery and loss of adequate capsular support. 
In the beginning of the vitrectomy, a small bubble of Perfluorocarbon liquid is injected above the macula to protect the posterior pole. Then, after removing all the vitreous, the surgeon uses a retinal forceps to bring the IOL into the anterior chamber and one of the haptics are externalized through a corneal incision.

Iris suture IOL fixation was programmed in this case using 10-0 prolene sutures with curved needles.

First the inferior haptic is sutured using McCannel technique.

The needle is inserted into the anterior chamber through a corneal incision, passes through the mid periphery of the iris and behind the haptic and it is externalized in the other side of the iris, and out of the cornea in the limbus . 
On the first attempt however, the suture passed behind the iris but did not involve the haptic. 

So the suture was removed and a iris spatula was used to lift the IOL optic and to create an haptic indentation. This way it is possible to better outline the haptic footprint.

Another tip that can make it easier to engage the haptic, is passing the needle toward the concavity of the haptic and not against it. 

In the McCannel technique, after passing the suture, a paracentesis is created at the midpoint of the throw. Then, both suture ends are gently externalized in a ""rabbit-ear"" fashion. The ends are tied in a 3-1-1 fashion to suture the first haptic.

At this moment, a miotic agent can be used to constrict the pupil. The spatula is used again to help the positioning of the second haptic behind the iris and to keep the optical zone of the IOL captured by the pupil. Then the second haptic is sutured superiorly following the same steps.
 
Finally the optical zone of the IOL is placed in the retropuppilar position and the PFCL is removed

pvrEHtDDG7k,conjunctival;scleral;retinal;,Macular Hole Surgery   Step by Step,"In this video shared by dr. Hasan Bahrani from Erbil Iraq, we discuss the surgical steps on PPV for the treatment of idiopathic macular holes.

In this procedure, the surgeon inserts 25-G trocars in a four-port system using a chandelier light.
 
Note that he makes conjunctival displacement using a forceps and that sclerotomies are made in a beveled angle and in a biplanar incision. 

The infusion line is filled with BSS, turned off for the insertion, and is only turned on again after checking its correct positioning on the pars plana. 
Chandelier light is a useful tool in macular hole surgery once it is possible to improve visualization during the peeling, and it allows the surgeon to perform scleral indentation by himself during shaving. In this case the surgeon placed the chandelier light superiorly.

Then, a non-contact viewing system is set, and after focusing, core vitrectomy is made. Triamcinolone acetonide is used to help PVD induction maneuver. After staining, the vitreous cutter is positioned in the nasal side of the optic disc and with maximal suction the posterior hyaloid is engaged in the aspiration port, and is pulled slowly toward the periphery. It's important to be careful about the possibility of idiopathic peripheral retinal breaks during this step. If necessary, this maneuver is repeated in all directions.
The peripheral vitreous should be shaved under scleral indentation as much as possible, before inserting the retinal forceps for peeling.

You can perform surgical capsulotomy if necessary and remember to keep the cornea well moisturized to improve visualization. Then, Brilliant blue dye is injected to stain the Internal limiting membrane.

To start peeling, it is important to avoid the papillomacular bundle so you might create irreversible visual field defects. Choose instead a well stained place and perform pinch and peel technique. 
First, make a tiny movement upward with your retinal forceps to grab the ILM and then release it to create an edge.

Then you rebrab the ILM and pull it circumferentially to complete the peeling. An area of 3 to 5 mm of diameter is enough to be peeled.
After checking the periphery and performing endolaser if necessary, fluid air exchange is made.

Finally, the trocars are removed and checked about air leakage. 
SF6 gas is then prepared in a 20% concentration to be injected.
In this case, the surgeon decided to suture the sclerotomies once during gas injection there was some leakage. So, Vicryl sutures were used to perform releasable scleroconjunctival sutures.

dWqjUtWgrbg,scleral;retinal;,Combined DSAEK and IOL scleral fixation,"This is a video shared by Dr. Gabriela Lopezcarasa from Mexico City - Mexico
 
This is a case of 52 YO male patient with poor outcome after Phaco-refractive surgery in the left eye.  He had an Inferior Retinal Detachment associated with vitreous hemorrhage following multiple surgeries for IOL exchange.
 
In the first procedure, the implanted single-piece IOL was removed through a corneal incision after cutting it in two pieces. After that, a 42 scleral Buckling was sutured in a termino-terminal technique. A standard three-port 23-Gauge pars plana vitrectomy was done removing all the vitreous from the anterior chamber and periphery and endolaser was made in the superior breaks. After fluid air exchange, a small amount of trapped fluid inferiorly was drained through a retinotomy. The patient remained aphakic under SF6 gas and the retina was completely attached. 
After one month, the patient developed Bullous keratopathy and corneal decompensation. His BCVA was 20/40 in the left eye, and a new procedure was programmed for IOL fixation of a CZ70BD IOL combined with DSAEK.
 
In the beginning of the procedure, the surgeon marks the positions for scleral sutures at 3 and 9 o’clock, and a 7.0mm corneal incision was programmed superiorly for IOL insertion. Clear cornea incisions were made with a Diamond knife and a crescent blade was used to build Hofmann pockets. The scleral pockets extend at least 3mm from the limbus.  

For the IOL fixation sutures, a bent 30-Gauge needle docked with 10-0 Nylon suture is inserted temporally 3.0mm from the limbus, through the scleral pockets. It is used as a loop to guide the Gore-Tex sutures through the 30-Gauge sclerotomy. After that, a new temporal sclerotomy was made 2mm from the first one, to grasp the other extremity of the Gore-tex suture. 
The same steps are repeated nasally and 2 loops of Gore-tex sutures are created for the IOL fixation. 

The CZ70BD IOL is an unfoldable single-piece IOL with eyelets on the haptics through which sutures can be passed for lens fixation. 10-0 Nylon sutures can be used to guide the Gore-Tex through its eyelets performing modified Cow-hitch sutures. This way it is possible to create a two-point fixation suture that allows more stability and to reduce the risk of IOL tilt. After suturing the eyelets bilaterally, the IOL is inserted into the anterior chamber. Then, the Gore-Tex sutures are retrieved from the scleral pockets and sutured in a 3-1-1 pattern. This way the knot slides under the roof of the scleral pockets which prevents erosion related complications. 

The sclerocorneal incision is partially sutured and DSAEK was performed by stripping the residual endothelium and placing the pre-cut 8 microns endothelial graft into the anterior chamber. In the end of the surgery a SF6 gas bubble was used to push the donor disc up against the host posterior stroma.

This is a case of a 42 YO, male patient with a history of open globe trauma in the right eye after a car accident, 14 days ago. He was submitted to sclerocorneal sutures on the same day of trauma.
In the ophthalmic exam his best correct visual acuity in the right eye was light perception.The slit lamp examination showed sclerocorneal sutures nasally and superiorly and a white traumatic cataract. It wasn't possible to see the retina in the fundoscopy and the ocular US scans showed inflammatory and/or hemorrhagic process with no RD ou IOFB signs.

A combined procedure with phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy was programmed 14 days after trauma. In the beginning of the surgery, before phaco, the surgeon placed a Chandelier light to help visualization of the posterior lens capsule. Hydro-dissection and delineation of the nucleus were avoided and the cortical cataract was removed by careful aspiration.
The remaining cortex was left to be removed by anterior vitrectomy.

For the vitrectomy, the surgeon needed to change the classic positions of the trocars to avoid incisions on the laceration area.
Blood and lens material dislocated to the vitreous cavity was removed with the vitrectomy probe. The vitrectomy of the periphery was made avoiding scleral indentation on the nasal quadrants. Therefore, prophylactic endolaser was made in that periphery even with no evident breaks.
A horseshoe-shaped tear was identified and treated in the superotemporal periphery. After shaving the vitreous base, a 3-pieces IOL was implanted in the ciliary sulcus and Fluid-air exchange was made. No gas or silicone oil were used in this procedure. 
His BCVA improved for 20/25 after a month. However after 2 months Epiretinal membrane formation worsened the vision again to 20/60 and a second procedure was programmed.

 This is a case of a 40 years old, male patient with recent macula on rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the right eye. In the exam the patient had BCVA of 20/20 in both eyes, clear lens and in the fundoscopy it was possible to see a horseshoe-shaped break at 10 o’clock, associated with small round holes at 9 o’clock and PVR A inferiorly. 
Scleral Buckling and cryopexy was chosen as a technique to treat this patient. So first, a 360º conjunctival peritomy with relaxing incisions were made, followed by isolation and looping of the rectus muscles.
Then A 25-gauge trocar is placed inferiorly 4mm from the limbus for the insertion of the Chandelier light. By using a wide-field viewing system, it is possible to obtain good visualization of the posterior pole and periphery with this technique, and it is an alternative to using an indirect ophthalmoscope to perform cryopexy.
The use of a chandelier endoillumination system improves visualization from far periphery and ensures accurate identification and precise cryotherapy, reducing the risk of missed breaks. 
Additionally, this approach improves teaching of the procedure once enabling the demonstration of cryopexy for trainees allowing direct microscope observation. 
Once the retinal breaks were on the superior quadrants, and the retinal detachment area was temporal, the surgeon decided to not perform incisions to drain the subretinal fluid in this case. So, after the cryopexy, the 25-gauge trocar was removed, and the incision was sutured. Instead of removing the Chandelier system in this step, you can alternately remove only the light fiber and plug the trocar. The buckle was placed behind the muscles and sutured in the sclera.
Although Chandelier-assisted scleral buckling takes advantage of the wide-field viewing system allowing better visualization of the far periphery and teaching methods, it transforms the procedure purely extraocular in an intraocular procedure. So, the surgeons need to be careful about the risk related to lens touch, vitreous tractions, iatrogenic breaks and infection. In this particular case, pneumatic retinopexy was associated with Scleral Buckling, and after anterior chamber paracentesis 0.5ml of SF6 gas was injected.

This is a patient with a poor outcome after cataract surgery in which a 3 pieces IOL, inserted in the ciliary sulcus has dislocated with the capsular complex to the vitreous cavity postoperatively.
 A new procedure was programmed, to perform intrascleral IOL fixation of the same dislocated lens using a technique called Inverted L IOL fixation.
In this technique described by Dr. Santiago Morales, two local conjunctival peritomy are made nasally and temporally. Then the surgeon marks two points 180º apart and a ""L shaped"" scleral sulcus is made on each side.
So the surgeon performs a scleral flap first temporally.
The nasal flap is made in the same way, but, note that the ""L shaped"" incision is made in the opposite direction from the other one.
Then a paracentesis is made, viscoelastic is injected, and the IOL is positioned in the anterior chamber above the iris.
The capsular complex with Soemmering's ring is then removed with the vitrector and complete pars plana vitrectomy is made.
After finishing PPV, two 20G sclerotomy is made bilaterally 2 mm from the limbus into the flaps. The nasal IOL haptic is grasped through the sclerotomy using two retinal forceps in handshake technique. The second IOL haptic is then externalized with a retinal forceps while the surgeon holds the first one. Then a scleral tunnel incision is made with a 27G needle to place the haptics intrascleral bilaterally.
In the end of the procedure, scleral flaps and conjunctiva are closed using Vrycril sutures.

mlSFzfho6CE,cataract surgery;retinal;,Tips and pearls on the management of a dislocated IOL,"In this video we discuss tips and pearls on the management of a dislocated IOL

This is a case of a patient with poor outcome after cataract surgery with dislocation of the IOL to the vitreous cavity in the first week postoperatively.

In the surgical planning of these procedures, it is important to check some details like, the type of the dislocated IOL, the status of its haptics and the presence or not of the remaining capsular complex. This way the surgeon can plan if the dislocated IOL needs to be removed and exchanged, or just repositioned in the ciliary sulcus

In this case there was intact anterior capsular support and it was a 3-pieces IOL without any damage dislocated to the vitreous cavity.

In the beginning of the vitrectomy, it is important to remove all the anterior vitreous in the pupillary plane. Try not to move so much the vitrector so you can avoid damage in the capsular complex. You can turn the microscope light off to increase the contrast and to see better the capsular support.

Be careful about the paralaxis effect caused by the dropped IOL, once you have two different optics media and you can lose the notion of depth depending on the position of the eye.

After vitreous core removal and PVD induction, it is necessary to remove all the vitreous traction around the IOL before dragging it to the anterior chamber. This way you can avoid traction in the periphery and retinal breaks. Remove also, as much as possible, the vitreous from the anterior chamber and shave the base before repositioning the IOL.

In this case, a retinal forceps was used to gently hold the IOL and drag it to the pupillary plane. Then one of the haptics is positioned above the iris. The retinal forceps keeps holding the IOL while the second haptic is dragged also to the anterior chamber with the help of a Chopper. With the IOL above the iris, the first haptic is positioned in the ciliary sulcus above the capsular support by carefully rotating the IOL. Then, the second haptic is gently dragged to the correct position.

Do not forget to review the vitreous base, removing remnant vitreous and performing endolaser in iatrogenic breaks if present.

Neste vídeo, discutimos dicas sobre o manejo de uma LIO deslocada para o vítreo

Este é um caso de paciente com complicação após cirurgia de catarata e com deslocamento da LIO para a cavidade vítrea na primeira semana de pós-operatório.

No planejamento cirúrgico desses procedimentos, é importante verificar alguns detalhes como, o tipo de LIO deslocada, o estado de suas alças e a presença ou não do complexo capsular. Desta forma, o cirurgião pode planejar se a LIO deslocada precisa ser removida e trocada, ou apenas reposicionada no sulco ciliar.

Nesse caso, havia suporte capsular anterior intacto e era uma LIO de três peças, sem qualquer dano, que estava deslocada para a cavidade vítrea.

No início da vitrectomia, é importante remover todo o vítreo anterior no plano pupilar. Tente não mover tanto o probe para evitar danos no complexo capsular. Você pode desligar a luz do microscópio para aumentar o contraste e ver melhor o suporte capsular.

Tenha cuidado com o efeito de paralaxe causado pela LIO deslocada, uma vez que você tem dois meios óticos diferentes e pode perder a noção de profundidade dependendo da posição do olho.

Após a remoção do núcleo vítreo e indução de DCVP, é necessário remover toda a tração vítrea ao redor da LIO antes de traze-la para a câmara anterior. Desta forma, você pode evitar tração na periferia e roturas retinianas. Remova também, tanto quanto possível, o vítreo da câmara anterior e faça a vitrectomia da base antes de reposicionar a LIO.

Nesse caso, uma pinça retiniana foi usada para segurar suavemente a LIO e traze-la até o plano pupilar. Em seguida, uma das alças é posicionada acima da íris. A pinça retiniana continua segurando a LIO enquanto o segundo háptico é puxado também para a câmara anterior com a ajuda de um Chopper. Com a LIO acima da íris, o primeiro háptico é posicionada no sulco ciliar acima do suporte capsular girando cuidadosamente a LIO. Então, o segundo háptico é suavemente arrastado para a posição correta.

Não se esqueça de revisar a base do vítreo, removendo o vítreo remanescente e realizando endolaser em quebras iatrogênicas se houver.",dislocated IOL,vitrectomy,LIO no vitreo,LIO mergulhada

This is a case of a 64 years old male patient with worsening in the visual acuity of the left eye 3 days ago.
He has already been submitted to pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil previously due to RRD and macular hole in the right eye
 His BCVA was 20/200 OD and hand motion in the left eye.
The slit lamp examination showed cataract in both eyes and in fundoscopy there was a Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with a single break at 1 o’clock.
Combined phaco and vitrectomy was programmed for this patient. In the beginning of the surgery, before phacoemulsification, the surgeon decided to place all the valved trocars and chandelier light. This approach allows you placing the trocars easier and can be useful to avoid iris prolapse, common when the trocars are chosen to be placed just after cataract surgery and with consequent hypotony.
Remember, however, to keep the infusion off until finishing the cataract surgery, and use plugs, if the valved trocars were not available.
After adjusting the focus, the surgeon starts with core vitrectomy and the PVD are checked. Heavy liquid is used to attach the retina and to condense the remnant vitreous in the periphery. Then, the vitreous base is shaved with a help of a scleral depressor and endolaser is made in the superior break. Fluid air exchange is made and in the end of the surgery the trocars are removed leaving only the infusion to inject the gas. In this case a syringe with C3F8 gas in a non-expanding concentration was attached to the infusion line and a needle is place superiorly to decompress the eye. The infusion cannula can be removed as soon as the eye achieved normotension.

Paciente do sexo masculino, 64 anos, com piora da acuidade visual do olho esquerdo há 3 dias. Paciente já foi submetido a vitrectomia via pars plana e óleo de silicone anteriormente devido a Descolamento de retina regmatogênico associado a buraco macular no olho direito
Sua acuidade visual corrigida era de 20/200 OD e movimento da mãos no olho esquerdo.
O exame com lâmpada de fenda mostrou catarata em ambos os olhos e na fundoscopia havia descolamento de retina regmatogênico com uma única rotura à 1 hora.
Facoemlsificação e vitrectomia via pars plana combinadas foram programadas para este paciente. No início da cirurgia, antes da facoemulsificação, o cirurgião decidiu colocar todos os trocartes valvulados e a Chandelier. Essa abordagem permite que você posicione os trocartes mais facilmente e pode ser útil para evitar o prolapso da íris, comum quando os trocartes são escolhidos para serem colocados logo após a cirurgia de catarata, e com consequente hipotonia.
Lembre-se, entretanto, de manter a infusão fechada até o término da cirurgia de catarata, e de usar plugues, caso os trocartes valvulados não estejam disponíveis.
Após ajustar o foco, o cirurgião começa com a vitrectomia do core e então do descolamento do vítreo posterior é verificado. Líquido pesado é usado para colar a retina e condensar o vítreo remanescente na periferia. Em seguida, o shaving da base vítrea é realizado com o auxílio de um depressor escleral, e é feito endolaser na rotura superior. É feita a troca de fluido de ar e no final da cirurgia os trocartes são retirados deixando apenas a via de infusão para injetar o gás.

This is a case of a large macular hole in a patient recently treated with scleral buckle for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
For this procedure, it was programmed pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling. The technique chosen by the surgeon was the inverted ILM flap technique.
 
There are some variations on this technique regarding the position of the flap. In the technique first described, the internal limiting membrane was peeled leaving it attached to all the circumference of the macular hole, and at the end of the surgery, the flap was inverted to fill the hole.
 
After finishing the peeling, due to the mobility of the Internal limiting membrane, it is difficult positioning the flap into the macular hole. So, the surgeon injected a perfluorocarbon liquid bubble at the posterior pole to stabilize the flap and help to keep it inside the hole.
In the end of the surgery the vitreous base was review and endolaser was performed in inferior breaks and then fluid air exchange are made.
The inverted ILM flap was kept stable in the correct position even after PFCL removal.

f-bPKEpcVDE,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Complicated cataract Surgery: Dropped Nucleus,"In this video we discuss the approach of a dropped nucleus following  cataract phacoemulsification.
This is a patient with visual acuity of count fingers due to a hard cataract submitted to phacoemulsification. For this procedure, peribulbar anesthesia was made and an implant of a 3-pieces monofocal IOL (MA60AC) was programmed. After circumferential capsulorhexis, hydrodissection was avoided but the hard cataract was rotated to certify that it is totally free inside the capsular bag. However, during the phacoemulsification, the surgeon noted posteriorly dislocation of the nucleus. In these cases, it is crucial that one stop aspiration and observe the nucleus to avoid tractions that can cause iatrogenic retinal breaks in the periphery.

Surgery was then converted to pars plana vitrectomy. A 4-port system with chandelier light was set.
First, the anterior vitreous is removed from the pupillary plane using the vitrector via pars plana and microscope light. You can eventually turn the chandelier on and the microscope light off to improve the visualization of the capsular complex and to avoid damage in the residual capsular support
The PVD induction is more difficult in the presence of a large dropped nucleus but it is a critical step to prevent iatrogenic breaks. A small bubble of Perfluorocarbon liquid can be used to avoid trauma in the posterior pole. Then the vitreous base is shaved and possible retinal breaks are treated with endolaser  if present.
In this procedure, the surgeon decided to levitate the nucleus until the pupillary plane by using PFCL instead of using the fragmatome. Once it wasn´t used a valved trocar system, plugs were placed to avoid PFCL loss or intense nucleus swirling.
A scleral depressor can be used to pull the nucleus to the correct position so it can be removed through phacoemulsification. 
Try not break the nucleus in several pieces to avoid that they dropped again to the vitreous cavity. A chopper can be used on the other hand to hold the fragment and bring it to the phaco handpiece.
Small fragments are then removed with the vitrector, and after vitreous base review a 3-pieces IOL can be implanted in the ciliary sulcus.

Neste vídeo, discutimos a abordagem de  núcleo no vítreo após complicação na cirurgia de catarata.
Trata-se de um paciente com acuidade visual de conta dedos  devido a uma catarata dura,  submetido a facoemulsificação. Para este procedimento, foi feita anestesia peribulbar e programado um implante de LIO monofocal de 3 peças (MA60AC). Após a capsulorrexis, a hidrodissecção foi evitada. O Núcleo duro foi girado para certificar que estava totalmente livre dentro do saco capsular. No entanto, durante a facoemulsificação, o cirurgião notou luxação posterior do núcleo. Nestes casos, é fundamental interromper a aspiração e observar o núcleo para evitar trações que podem causar rupturas retinianas iatrogênicas na periferia.

A cirurgia foi então convertida para vitrectomia via pars plana. em um sistema de 4 portas com Chandelier.
Primeiro, o vítreo anterior é removido do plano pupilar usando o vitrector via pars plana e luz de microscópio. Você pode eventualmente ligar a Chandelier e desligar a luz do microscópio  para melhorar a visualização do complexo capsular e evitar danos no suporte capsular residual.
A indução do DVP é mais difícil na presença de um grande núcleo caído, mas é uma etapa essencial para evitar roturas iatrogênicas. Uma pequena bolha de Perfluorocarbono  pode ser usada para evitar traumas no polo posterior. Em seguida, a base vítrea removida e possíveis rupturas retinianas são tratadas com endolaser, se presentes
Nesse procedimento, o cirurgião decidiu levitar o núcleo até o plano pupilar usando PFCL em vez de usar o facofragmentador. Uma vez que não foi utilizado sistema de trocater valvulado, foram colocados plugs para evitar a perda do PFCL ou turbilhonamento intenso do núcleo.
Um depressor escleral pode ser usado para empurrar o núcleo para a posição correta, de modo que ele possa ser removido por facoemulsificação.
Tente não quebrar o núcleo em vários pedaços para evitar que caiam novamente na cavidade vítrea. Por outro lado, um cortador pode ser usado para segurar o fragmento e trazê-lo para a peça de mão da faco.
Pequenos fragmentos são então removidos com o vitrector e, após a revisão da base vítrea, uma LIO de 3 peças pode ser implantada no sulco ciliar.

In this video we discuss tips on combined scleral Buckle and vitrectomy for Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

This is a case of recurrent RRD treated with combined SB and PPV. In the begging of the surgery a circumferential peritomy is made. It is important to start the peritomy 2mm from the limbus to either facilitate closure and to preserve the Goblet cells. Radial relieving incisions at 3 and 9 o’clock can also facilitate the proper repositioning while suturing the conjunctiva in the end of the surgery. Then, a closed pair of blunt scissors is pushed through the intermuscular septum between two recti muscles. By spreading the blades, the sub-tenon space is enlarged for proper scleral exposition. The same steps are made in all quadrants.
The rectus muscles are engaged with a sweeping posterior and circumferential movement around the globe with a muscle hook. In this step one should avoid very posterior “sweeps” to prevent damage to the vortex veins. Once a rectus has been hooked, the globe moves with the hook. A second hook can be passed from the opposite side to help dissection of the remaining anterior fibers of the intermuscular septum. Special attention is required hooking the lateral and superior rectus muscles, once there is a risk of inadvertently oblique muscles hooking. Remember to start the movement in the superotemporal quadrant in both cases. The lateral rectus is hooked from the superior to the inferior side, and the superior rectus from the temporal to the nasal side. 
An oblique cut in the extremity of the buckle can help to pass it under the muscles. Turn the buckle in a way that the tip faces the insertion of the muscle to makes it easier. Avoid holding the buckle in a perpendicular angle or your forceps will hit the muscle and make this step more difficult. Instead, hold the forceps and the buckle in a linear way.
You can use either Nylon or Polyester to suture the buckle. It’s important to program the sutures bites parallel to the long axis of the explant and with 1 to 1.5mm on each side of the buckle. Mattress sutures with a square configuration allow more effective indentation. The sutures have to be partial thickness from 1/2 to 2/3. During the suture, you are able to better control the thickness by making undulatory movements while pushing the needle. Before the sutures, remember always to exam the sclera to avoid sutures in areas of scleral thinning or near the vortex veins.
Scleral mattress sutures have to be tied under tension to create an indent. Slip knot sutures can be made in this step. Do a single “forward throw” first. Avoiding crisscross, the suture and then do a single reverse throw. Pull one of the extremities of the suture to keep the tension and the knot will slip to create a local indent. Slip knots require extra throws after tension to lock the knot and prevent later slippage. After suturing all the quadrants, the ends of the band have to be fastened to each other. In cases of hypotony, a paracentesis or a BSS pars plana injection can be made to correct the IOP before suturing the extremities of the band. The ends of the band are cut and pulled together, and a 6-mm shortening is programmed with a caliper to create the indentation. You can use either a Watzke sleeve or X-sutures to tighten the buckle.
In this case, after performing scleral buckle, a pars plana vitrectomy was made. Patient had a recurrent retinal detachment with shortening of the inferior retina and an inferior retinectomy was necessary. In the end of surgery, after silicone oil injection, 7-0 Vycril sutures were used to close the sclerotomies and the conjunctiva.

BXDekr8RE_0,scleral;retinal;,Yamane technique with fewer incisions (Pearls on IOL scleral fixation),"This is a video shared by Dr. Hiroto Ishikawa from Nishinomiya Japan

The flanged IOL scleral fixation with double-needle technique was described in 2019 and uses a 31-gauge needle and needle stabilizer. However, in the original Yamane technique, the number of surgical wounds required are six (one for IOL insertion, three for vitrectomy trocars and two for removing the haptics.

In this video the surgeon describes a modified Yamane technique, in which the same 27-gauge trocars of PPV are used to externalize the haptics and perform the flanges, decreasing the number of surgical wounds.
After marking the positions of the haptics at 2 and 8 o’clock, 27-gauge trocars are inserted 2mm from the limbus. Anterior chamber incisions are made, and the infusion is placed in the inferotemporal trocar for the vitrectomy and dislocated IOL extraction.
To manage insufficient mydriasis a pupillary sphincterotomy was made using retinal scissors.
The dislocated IOL and the capsular complex are first cut and then removed through the corneal incision. Then, the vitreous was removed from the anterior chamber with the vitrector and a complete PPV with noncontact wide-field vision system was made. 
After vitrectomy, the infusion line is changed to the superotemporal trocar.
A 3-pieces IOL with PDVF haptics (NX 70s, Santen, Japan) is implanted into the anterior chamber with the injector. Then, a 27-gauge needle is inserted into the nasal trocar at 2 o’clock and a forceps is used to help trailing the haptic into the needle.
The nasal needle is not removed at this moment. Likewise, the second haptic is inserted through a 27-gauge needle at 8 o’clock.
For the externalization of the haptics, the double-needle should not be removed alone. Instead, the trocar and the needle should be removed gently together leaving just the haptic outside. Once the scleral tunnel size formed by the 27-gauge trocar is larger than that formed by a 27-gauge needle (used in the original Yamane technique), 1.5mm length of the haptic is marked for cauterization to create a bigger flange.
This is a useful technique for retinal surgeons in which is possible to reduce the number of required wounds to flanged IOL scleral fixation with double-needle.

A fixação escleral usando de uma lente intraocular com duas agulhas e com flanges foi descrita em 2019. Ela usa agulhas de calibre 31 gauge e um instrumento estabilizador para a confecção do túnel com a agulha. Na técnica original de Yamane, o número de incisões cirúrgicas necessárias é seis (uma para a inserção da LIO, três para trocateres da vitrectomia e duas para a externalização dos hápticos.
Neste vídeo, o cirurgião descreve uma técnica de Yamane modificada, em que os mesmos trocartes de 27-gauge da vitrectomia via pars plana são usados para externalizar as alças e realizar os flanges, diminuindo o número de incisões cirúrgicas.
Depois de marcar as posições dos hápticos nas 2 e 8 horas, trocartes de 27-gauge são inseridos a 2 mm do limbo. As incisões da câmara anterior são feitas, e a infusão é colocada no trocater temporal inferior para a vitrectomia e extração da LIO deslocada.
Para melhorar a midríase, uma esfincterotomia pupilar foi feita com uma tesoura.
A LIO deslocada e o complexo capsular são cortados e depois removidos através da incisão corneana. Em seguida, o vítreo é removido da câmara anterior com o vitrector e a VVPP com sistema de visão de campo amplo sem contato foi realizada.
Após a vitrectomia, a linha de infusão é trocada para o trocater temporal superior
Uma LIO de 3 peças com hápticos de PDVF (NX 70s – Santen, Japan) é implantada na câmara anterior com o injetor. Em seguida, uma agulha de 27-gauge é inserida no trocater nasal às 2 horas e uma pinça é utilizada para ajudar a passar o háptico dentro do lumen,
A agulha nasal não deve ser removida neste momento. Da mesma forma, o segundo háptico é inserido através de uma agulha 27-gauge às 8 horas.
Para a externalização das alças, a agulha não deve ser removida sozinha. Ao invés disso, o trocater e a agulha devem ser removidos suavemente em conjunto, deixando apenas o haptico da LIO para fora. Uma vez que o tamanho do túnel escleral formado pelo trocater de 27-gauge é maior do que o formado por uma agulha de 27-gauge (usada na técnica de Yamane original), 1,5 mm de comprimento da alça é marcada para cauterização e para criar um flange maior.
Essa é uma técnica útil para cirurgiões de retina, na qual é possível reduzir o número de incisões necessárias para a fixação escleral da LIO com a técnica de Yamane.

I3_wam7QuDo,scleral;retinal;,Macular hole and retinal detachment - ILM peeling techniques with or Without PFCL,"In these videos shared by Dr. Daniel Louzada from São Paulo and Juliana Prazeres from Salvador Brazil we discuss two techniques of ILM peeling in detached retina.

The surgical management for macular holes associated with retinal detachment is usually more challenging than a typical ILM peeling for idiopathic macular holes. Besides the difficulty to peel the ILM over the detached and mobile retina, there is still additional potential risk of toxicity related to dye gaining access to the subretinal space.
 
In this first video the patient had a retinal detachment and macular hole after blunt ocular trauma. The surgeon performed circumferential scleral buckling combined with PPV and the ILM peeling was made without use of heavy liquids.
 
It’s important in these cases to try to reduce the subretinal fluid in the posterior pole by aspirating through the break or creating a posterior retinotomy.

Brilliant blue dye is injected in three or four jet streams around the macula, away from the hole. The ILM peeling is initiated using pinch-and-peel technique with ILM peeling forceps. Other instruments like a Finesse flex loop or a Diamond dusted membrane scraper can also be useful in this step.

After the initial break in the ILM, peeling must be done tangentially avoiding pulling the retina anteriorly and other maneuvers that can enlarge the macular hole. Sometimes it can be easier done by removing little strips from the ILM. 
The technique of ILM peeling in retinal detachment without use of PFCL can be useful in cases of high myopia and posterior staphyloma especially when longer retinal forceps it’s not available.

The second video, shared by Dr. Daniel Louzada, shows a recurrent retinal detachment associated with macular hole. The surgeon performs Fluid air exchange and the ILM is dyed with brilliant blue under air. Then a bubble of heavy liquid is injected to stabilize the retina and make it less mobile during ILM peeling. Under PFCL it can be more difficult to start an ILM edge using Diamond dusted scraper or Flex loop. A good stain and a broad initial edge are critical to help visualize the ILM once because of PFCL the ILM will be pushed down.  Both approaches are safe and effective, and the choice of the technique varies in each case and depends on surgeons preference.

Nestes vídeos compartilhados por Dr. Daniel Louzada de São Paulo e Juliana Prazeres de Salvador – Brasil, discutimos duas técnicas de peeling de ILM em descolamento de retina.
O tratamento cirúrgico para buracos maculares associados ao descolamento de retina é geralmente mais desafiador do que um peeling de ILM típico para buracos maculares idiopáticos. Além da dificuldade técnica em realizar o ILM sobre a retina descolada e móvel, ainda há risco potencial adicional de toxicidade relacionada ao acesso do corante ao espaço sub-retiniano.
No primeiro vídeo, o paciente apresentou descolamento de retina e buraco macular após trauma ocular contuso. Foi indicado procedimento de introflexão escleral associada a vitrectomia via pars plana e o peeling de ILM foi realizado sem o uso de líquidos pesados.
É importante, nesses casos, tentar reduzir o fluido sub-retiniano no pólo posterior, aspirando através da rotura, ou criando uma retinotomia posterior.
O azul brilhante é injetado em três ou quatro correntes de jato ao redor da mácula, fora da área do buraco macular. O peeling de ILM é iniciado usando a técnica pinch-and-peel com pinça de peeling de membrana limitante interna. Outros instrumentos, como a Finesse flex-loop ou um Tano (Diamond dusted scraper), também podem ser úteis nesta etapa.
Após a ruptura inicial da MLI, o peeling deve ser feito tangencialmente evitando puxar a retina anteriormente e evitandooutras manobras que possam alargar o buraco macular. Nestes casos, pode ser mais fácil remover pequenas tiras do MLI ao invés do peeling circunferencial típico.
A técnica de peeling de ILM em descolamento de retina sem uso de PFCL pode ser útil em casos de alta miopia e estafiloma posterior, especialmente quando uma pinça retiniana mais longa não está disponível.
O segundo vídeo, compartilhado pelo Dr. Daniel Louzada, mostra um descolamento de retina recorrente associado a buraco macular. O cirurgião realiza a troca de ar fluido e a MLI é corada com azul brilhante sob ar. Em seguida, uma bolha de perfluor é injetada para estabilizar a retina e torná-la menos móvel durante o peeling da MLI. Sob o PFCL, pode ser mais difícil iniciar uma quebra na MLI usando Tano ou a Flex-loop. Obter boa visualização através dos corantes e realizar uma borda inicial ampla são essenciais para ajudar a o peeling uma vez que, devido ao PFCL, a MLI será empurrado para baixo. Ambas as abordagens são seguras e eficazes, e a escolha da técnica varia em cada caso e depende da preferência do cirurgião.",macular hole,buraco macular,retinal detachment,descolamento de retina,ILM peeling,peeling

A surgical procedure for scleral fixation of an Akreos IOL using Goretex sutures was programmed to this patient previously submitted to PPV and lensectomy after penetrant ocular trauma.

An infusion cannula is placed inferotemporally and then two localized conjunctival peritomies are created 180° apart. Four additional sclerotomies are made 2.8 mm posterior to the limbus and 3 mm apart. 

The CV-8 Gore-Tex sutures are passed first through two IOL haptics outside the eye. Another half of the suture is used to fixate the contralateral haptics.

Using retinal forceps through 25-gauge trocars, the surgeon grasps each tip of the Gore-Tex suture to fixate the IOL in four points. 

In this step is important avoiding crisscross the sutures.

After sutured, the IOL is folded using a Machpherson forceps and inserted through a superior corneal wound.
 
Then the IOL is centralized, trocars are removed, and the sutures are tied in a 3-1-1 fashion. 
In the end of the surgery, the knots are rotated and buried inside the sclera.

Um procedimento cirúrgico para fixação escleral de uma LIO Akreos com Gore-tex foi programado para este paciente previamente submetido a vitrectomia via pars plana e lensectomia após trauma ocular penetrante.

Uma cânula de infusão é colocada na região  temporal inferior e, em seguida, duas peritomias conjuntivais localizadas são criadas a 180° uma da outra. Quatro esclerotomias adicionais são feitas 2,8 mm posterior ao limbo e a 3 mm de distância uma da outra.

O fio do Gore-Tex CV-8 é passado primeiro por duas alças de LIO fora do olho. A outra metade da sutura é usada para fixar as alças contralaterais.

Usando uma pinça retiniana através de trocateres de 25-G, a cirurgiã puxa cada ponta da sutura Gore-Tex para fixar a LIO em quatro pontos.

Nesta etapa é importante evitar cruzar as suturas.

Depois de passados os fios, a LIO é dobrada com uma pinça de Machpherson e inserida através de uma incisão corneana superior.
 
Em seguida, a LIO é centralizada, os trocateres são removidos e as suturas são amarradas em um padrão de 3-1-1.
No final da cirurgia, os nós são girados e sepultados dentro da esclera."
nUhaNFcFRy8,conjunctival;scleral;pupilloplasty;retinal;,Yamane Technique: Dislocated IOL after ocular trauma,"This is a video shared by Dr. Marlon Garcìa Roa from Querétaro México
This patient had a single piece IOL dislocated to the vitreous cavity after ocular trauma.
A new surgical procedure was indicated to remove the luxated IOL through a superior scleral incision and scleral fixation of a 3-pieces IOL.
First, a conjunctival dissection is made superiorly, followed by diathermy and a linear incision to prepare the scleral tunnel. Then the trocars are inserted to start the pars plana vitrectomy.
In the beginning of the vitrectomy, it's important to remove all the vitreous around the IOL before to bring it anteriorly, so you can avoid peripheral traction and retinal breaks
Perfluorocarbon liquid can be useful either to protect the posterior pole of possible surgical trauma and to help the IOL removal.
In this case, the surgeon decided to perform Yamane Technique for a sutureless scleral fixation of the new IOL.
Two anterior chamber paracentisis were made at 2 and 9 o´clock, and then the surgeon removed the single-piece IOL through the scleral tunnel.
So, the incision sites were marked with a caliper and a needle is inserted first temporally in the direction that the haptic will be externalized, to achieve proper IOL positioning. The retinal forceps are used to guide the haptic to the needle lumen in a bimanual technique.
Managing hypotony can be challenging in this step once there is a large incision in the sclera. The auxiliary surgeon can help to control the flux of the infusion turning it on and off as needed.
The second needle is inserted contralaterally to fixate the other haptic into the sclera. Utmost care must be taken at this moment to avoid haptic damage that can lead to distortion and consequently tilt or IOL decentration.
After externalizing both haptics, a cautery is used to form a button-like tip at the end of each haptic. The haptics are placed intrascleral and there is no need to use sutures or glue.
In the end of the procedure, the surgeon made a pupilloplasty superiorly using 10-0 prolene sutures

Este paciente teve uma LIO de peça única deslocada para a cavidade vítrea após trauma ocular. Um novo procedimento cirúrgico foi indicado para remoção da LIO luxada por meio de incisão escleral superior e fixação escleral de LIO de 3 peças.
Primeiramente, uma dissecção conjuntival é feita superiormente, seguida por diatermia e uma incisão linear para preparar o túnel escleral. Em seguida, os trocateres são inseridos para iniciar a vitrectomia via pars plana. No início da vitrectomia, é importante remover todo o vítreo ao redor da LIO antes de trazê-la anteriormente, para que você possa evitar tração periférica e roturas retinianas. O perfluor pode ser útil tanto para proteger o pólo posterior de um possível trauma cirúrgico quanto para auxiliar na remoção da LIO.
Nesse caso, o cirurgião decidiu realizar a técnica de Yamane para a fixação escleral sem sutura da nova LIO. Duas paracenteses de câmara anterior foram feitas às 2 e 9 horas e, em seguida, o cirurgião removeu a LIO de peça única através do túnel escleral.
Em seguida, os locais de incisão são marcados e uma agulha é inserida primeiro temporalmente, na direção em que o haptico será externalizado, para obter o posicionamento adequado da LIO. Pinças de retiniana são usadas para guiar o haptico até o lúmen da agulha usando técnica bimanual.
O manejo de hipotonia pode ser desafiador nesta etapa, uma vez que há uma grande incisão na esclera. O cirurgião auxiliar pode ajudar a controlar o fluxo da infusão, ligando e desligando conforme necessário.
A segunda agulha é inserida contralateralmente para fixar o outro haptico na esclera. O máximo cuidado deve ser tomado neste momento para evitar danos nas alças, que podem levar à distorção e, conseqüentemente, inclinação ou descentralização da LIO.
Depois de externalizar ambos os hápticos, um cautério é usado para formar o flange. As alças são colocadas no espaço intraescleral e não há necessidade de usar suturas ou cola.

Ao final do procedimento, o cirurgião realizou pupiloplastia superior com fio de prolene 10-0",scleral fixation,fixacao escleral,yamane
TWxp2eWKNHU,phacoemulsification;retinal;,Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: Removal of subretinal membranes,"In this video we discuss a technique for subretinal membranes removal.
This is a surgery of silicone oil removal indicated six months after combined phacoemulsification and vitrectomy to treat RRD.  
In the beginning of the surgery, due to poor mydriasis and posterior capsule opacities, it was difficult to check the correct position of the cannula before opening the infusion line. You can use the back of a forceps as a mirror to help in this step. If the correct position of the infusion line is still uncertain, keep the infusion closed and try to check at the beginning of the vitrectomy.
In this case a 23-gauge Oil Extraction MedOne cannula was used for silicone oil removal. A standard four-port trocar system with Chandelier light was programmed once the patient had subretinal proliferations to be removed in the procedure.
Under BIOM visualization it was possible finally to check the infusion cannula position and turn it on. Then, a surgical capsulotomy was made, to allow better fundus visualization during the silicone oil extraction.
The Oil Extraction cannula has a silicone tube specially shaped to be attached and the silicone oil can be removed either with a standard syringe or with a pump system. During extraction, it’s important to keep the tip of the aspiration cannula inside the silicone bubble, and not in the BSS phase, so you can avoid globe collapse.
The silicone oil removal procedure is an ideal opportunity to deal with situations that can lead to recurrent RD or other problems. 
In this case, the patient had subretinal membranes lifting the retina in the inferior midperiphery. Tripan blue dye was used to check for PVR and ERM to be also removed.
For the subretinal band removal, first Diathermy is made in the middle of the membrane area. Then, the subretinal membrane is grasped with a retinal forceps through a small retinotomy and it is gently moved side to side until the membrane breaks. You can do yet, bimanual technique using forceps and the vitrector to remove all the membrane with minimal peripheral traction.
Even with previous diathermy, a subretinal hemorrhage threatens to go under the macula. So, a small bubble of perfluor was injected until the level of the retinotomy to avoid submacular blood and to perform endolaser. Fluid air exchange was made slowly with a flute needle in passive aspiration to drain all the subretinal fluid and in the end of the surgery, C3F8 14% gas was injected.
 
Neste vídeo, discutimos uma técnica para remoção de membranas subretinianas. Esta é uma cirurgia de retirada do óleo de silicone indicada 6 meses após FACO+VVPP para tratamento de Descolamento de Retina Regmatogênico. No início, devido à pouca dilatação, e opacidades da cápsula posterior, foi difícil verificar o correto posicionamento da cânula antes de abrir a infusão. Você pode usar a parte de trás de uma pinça como espelho nesta etapa. Se a posição correta da infusão ainda for incerta, mantenha fechada e tente reavaliar o início da VVPP. Neste caso, uma cânula de extração de óleo 23-G foi usada para a remoção do OS. Um sistema de trocater padrão em quatro portas com uso da Chandelier foi programado, uma vez que o paciente apresentava proliferações subretinianas para serem removidas. Com o BIOM foi possível finalmente verificar a posição correta da infusão e ligá-la. A seguir, foi realizada capsulotomia, para permitir melhor visualização do fundo durante a extração do OS. A cânula de extração de óleo tem um tubo de silicone com formato especial para ser conectado, e o OS pode ser removido com uma seringa padrão ou com um sistema de bomba. Durante a extração, é importante manter a ponta da cânula de aspiração dentro da bolha do OS, e não dentro do BSS, para que você possa evitar o colapso do globo. O procedimento de remoção do OS é uma oportunidade ideal para lidar com situações que podem levar a DR recorrente ou outros problemas. Nesse caso, o paciente apresentava membranas subretinianas elevando a retina na média periferia inferior. Azul Tripan foi usado para verificar se havia PVR e membranas epi a serem removidos. Para a remoção da banda subretiniana, primeiro é feita a diatermia no meio da área da membrana. Em seguida, a membrana subretiniana é apreendida com uma pinça retiniana por meio de uma pequena retinotomia e é movida suavemente de um lado para o outro até que a membrana se rompa. Você pode fazer ainda, técnica bimanual usando pinça e o vitrector para remover toda a membrana com tração periférica mínima. Mesmo com diatermia feita anteriormente, uma hemorragia subretiniana ameaçava passar por baixo da mácula. Assim, uma pequena bolha de perfluor foi injetada até o nível da retinotomia para evitar sangue submacular e realizar endolaser. A troca fluido-ar foi feita lentamente com a softip em aspiração passiva para drenar todo o líquido subretiniano, e ao final da cirurgia foi injetado gás C3F8 a 14%.

kPWhTdpTwFo,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple breaks,"This is video shared by Dr. Juliana Prazeres from Salvador - Brazil
This is a case of a 56 yo male with worsening in vision OD in the last week. 
Patient had already been submitted to cataract surgery in both eyes and in the fundoscopy it was possible to see multiple retinal breaks in different levels around the periphery. The surgeon decided to perform combined Scleral Buckling and PPV in this case.
After suturing the scleral buckling, Valved 23-G trocars and a Chandelier light were placed. In the beginning of the surgery, after core vitrectomy, the vitreous tractions around the breaks were removed. 
In this step you can turn the mouth of the vitrector away from the retina, and it's important to use low vacuum and high cut rates to avoid causing iatrogenic or even enlarge retinal breaks.
Adjuncts like Triamcinolone can be useful to ensure that all the posterior hyaloid is removed.
Careful must be taken with the vitrector during PVD maneuver to avoid retinal breaks in a bullous retinal detachment area.
In cases of multiple retinal breaks like this, PFCL it´s a important tool once you can stabilize the retina and condense the vitreous on the periphery to safely shave the base. 
Don´t inject PFCL under pressure to avoid fish eggs bubbles that can occasionally migrate to the subretinal space. If it happens, try to aspirate all the bubbles, or transform it in a single bubble by carefully touching it.
After Perfluor injection you are able to use higher vacuum rates to perform the vitrectomy of the base.  Chandelier light is useful in this step once you can safely indent the scleral by yourself during shaving.
It's important  to remove the retinal flap from the breaks to ensure release all tractions in the base. You can use the scleral depressor to move the flaps always from the EPR and Choroid for safety removal.
When the eye is filled up with PFCL and you can see a double line in the periphery, it means that there is remnant vitreous in that place to be shaved.
Endolaser was performed 360º in the periphery before fluid air exchange
In cases of multiple retinal breaks in different levels, like in this surgery, it's important to perform Fluid air exchange from the most anterior break and to the most posterior one.
After finishing FAX the endolaser was completed in the periphery and silicone oil was chosen as tamponade.

Este é um caso de paciente de 56 anos, sexo masculino, com piora de OD de visão na última semana.
O paciente já havia sido submetido à cirurgia de catarata em ambos os olhos e na fundoscopia foi possível observar múltiplas roturas retinianas em diferentes níveis ao redor da periferia. O cirurgião decidiu realizar a Faixa + Vitrectomia via pars plana neste caso.
Após a sutura da faixa, trocartes valvulados de 23-G e Chandelier foram colocados. No início da cirurgia, após a vitrectomia do core, as trações vítreas ao redor das roturas foram removidas. Nesta etapa, você pode afastar a boca do vitrector para o lado contrário a retina, e é importante usar vácuo baixo e taxas de corte altas para evitar causar iatrogenia ou até mesmo aumentar as roturas retinianas.
Adjuntos como a Triancinolona podem ser úteis para garantir que toda a hialóide posterior seja removido. Deve-se ter cuidado com o vitrector durante a manobra de DVP para evitar rupturas de retina em uma área de descolamento bolhoso. Em casos de múltiplas roturas retinianas como essa, o PFCL é uma ferramenta importante, uma vez que você pode estabilizar a retina e condensar o vítreo na periferia para o shaving da base com segurança.
Não injete PFCL sob pressão para evitar bolhas multiplas (fish-eggs)  que podem ocasionalmente migrar para o espaço sub-retiniano. Se isso acontecer, tente aspirar todas as bolhas, ou transformá-la em uma única bolha tocando-a com cuidado. Após a injeção de Perfluor, você pode usar taxas de vácuo mais altas para realizar a vitrectomia da base. A Chandelier é útil nesta etapa, uma vez que você pode indentar com segurança para si a área do shaving. É importante remover a aba retiniana das roturas para garantir a liberação de todas as trações na base.
Você pode usar o depressor escleral para mover os flaps longe do EPR e da Coróide para uma remoção mais segura. Quando o olho está preenchido com PFCL, e você vê uma linha dupla na periferia, significa que há vítreo remanescente naquele local a ser removido. Endolaser foi realizado 360º na periferia antes da troca de fluido-ar.
Em casos de múltiplas roturas retinianas em diferentes níveis, como nesta cirurgia, é importante realizar a troca fluido-ar iniciando na rotura mais anterior e movendo para a mais posterior.

A2_3S038Dcw,posterior capsulotomy;retinal;,Silicone oil removal through the anterior chamber,"This is a video shared by Dr. José Lopez Roca from Buenos Aires - Argentine
 
In this video we discuss a technique of silicone oil extraction through a posterior capsulotomy in aphakic patients.
 
This patient was previously submitted to Phacoemulsification and PPV with silicone oil implant. The IOL wasn’t implanted in the first procedure.

Using high vacuum and low-cut rates, the surgeon first performs a capsulotomy with the vitrector through a corneal incision.

Then a 20-gauge Abbocath is inserted into the anterior chamber to manual aspiration of the silicone oil.

 It’s important to keep the tip inside the Silicone oil bubble all time to avoid surge and globe collapse during the extraction. This way you can avoid also that small bubbles split and keep hidden behind the iris in the periphery.  
 
The advantage of this technique is the surgical time, with fast procedure, once you are able to remove the silicone oil easily with the 20-gauge Abbocath.

It's possible to perform retina overview by using a light probe inserted through the anterior chamber and a non contact viewing system

In the end of the surgery a 3-pieces IOL was implanted in the ciliary sulcus.

This is a case of a patient previously submitted to scleral sutures and anterior chamber washout after penetrating ocular trauma in his left eye 2 months ago. CT scans didn´t show the presence of an Intraocular foreign body, but because of persistent vitreous hemorrhage and traumatic cataract a second procedure was indicated.

After phacoemulsification and IOL implant, the anterior vitreous and capsular opacities were removed. It's possible to see a residual vitreous hemorrhage inferiorly and a fibrotic epiretinal membrane nasally in the midperiphery. 

After staining with both triamcinolone and trypan blue,the surgeon removed carefully the Posterior hyaloid and the epiretinal membrane. There weren't retinal breaks in the periphery and the endolaser was made only in the area of the dense membrane removed.

In the end of the surgery, repair of iridodialysis was made.

First, a conjunctival dissection is made nasally followed by cauterization and a scleral sulcus. A 30-gauge needle is passed through the iris root, out of the angle. A double-armed, 10-0 polypropylene suture is passed through a contralateral paracentesis and it is grasped with the needle.

The same maneuver is made again to fix the iridodialysis area, and the knot is tied on the surface of the globe under the scleral sulcus.

This is a case of a 9 yo male patient with Pierre Robin Syndrome and RRD in the right eye. 
 
Surgical planning included Encircling scleral buckling combined with phacoemulsification and Pars plana vitrectomy.
 
Patient had a complex Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment case with a close funnel shaped PVR.
 
In cases like this it is important to place a Chandelier light, so you are able to better visualize the membranes and to perform bimanual techniques.
 
After core vitrectomy, subretinal fluid aspiration and removal on the anterior vitreous, the surgeon performed different maneuvers to ensure the most as possible membranes are peeled off. 
The membranes are very stiff and adherent, and the utmost care should be taken to avoid iatrogenic retinal breaks

The vitrector tip, a pick forceps or bimanual techniques with forceps and scissors can be used to membrane peeling. In this case the surgeon used two retinal forceps to carefully remove all the peripheral membranes.

Brilliant blue dye can be useful to stain the membranes and to ensure the posterior hyaloid is totally removed. 
 
In eyes with anterior PVR like this, membrane peeling sometimes will not relieve all the traction. In that case, it is necessary to perform a relaxing retinectomy to adequately relieve the traction and flatten the retina.

3N7OIprqz1o,conjunctival;scleral;pupilloplasty;retinal;,IOL Fixation Techniques - Carlevale IOL,"This is a video shared by Dr. Diego Ruiz Casas from Madrid - Spain

In this video we discuss a technique of IOL scleral fixation using the Carlevale IOL.

This patient was submitted to scleral corneal sutures and PPV after severe penetrating ocular trauma 4 months ago.

After conjunctival peritomy and scleral diathermy, two linear incisions are made at 3 and 9 o´clock. Using a crescent blade, scleral pockets are made superiorly and inferiorly from each incision.

As it was an aphakic eye, the surgeon performed silicone oil removal through the anterior chamber.
Brilliant blue was used and all the adherent membranes and the internal limiting membrane was peeled.

In cases of IOL fixation after silicone oil removal, it's important to shave again the base to remove all the remaining droplets.
 You can also do repeated Fluid-air exchange to get rid of all of these emulsified droplets.

Back to the anterior segment, bilaterally sclerotomies are made 1,5 mm from the limbus. The Carlevale IOL is injected into the anterior chamber and with a help of 25-gauge retinal forceps the plugs of the lens are grabbed and driven through the scleral tunnel. Once it is removed through the sclera, the plug is placed onto scleral pockets. Vycril sutures are made in the incisions bilaterally.

After IOL fixation, the surgeon performed iris reconstruction to fix paralytic mydriasis and the area of iris desinsertion. The elasticity of the iris was checked first and then pupilloplasty with Siepster knots was made. 
A scleral sulcus was also made inferiorly 0.5mm from the limbus and Iridopexy was performed to fix the area of desinsertion.

This is the aspect of the eye after severe penetrating ocular trauma 4 months before, and the final aspect of the eye after two surgical procedures.

ud8mNvHrTaI,conjunctival;retinal;enucleation;muscle;,Ocular Trauma Principles,"This is a case shared by Dr. Diego Ruiz Casas from Madrid - Spain
 
In this video we discuss important principles guiding the repair of complex corneoscleral lacerations in ocular traumas.
 
This is a case of a patient with severe ocular trauma and visual acuity of no light perception. The first important message in surgery for ocular trauma is: Don’t perform primary enucleation or evisceration. Try always to close the eye and restore as much as possible the structural integrity of the globe. 
 
Close the eye as soon as possible to avoid choroidal detachment and infection. 
 
The goal of the first procedure is to close the eye. If possible, you can try to fix some intraocular injuries, but if not possible, leave it to another surgical intervention.
 
Start the sutures at the limbus and the wound apex with interrupted 10-0 Nylon sutures.
 
Tissues bites should initially be placed full thickness deep into cornea to close the endothelium gaps and avoid further edema during the surgery. However, the first sutures are difficult, due to hypotony and if they are too or little thighted they can be changed at the end of the surgery.
 
In this procedure, the surgeon used a vitreous probe to remove the prolapsed vitreous from the wound and anterior chamber. Avoid always to pull the vitreous and to cut with scissors so you can avoid further traction. Pay special attention suturing the limbal gaps trying the most linear apposition. 
 
We can see that the eye acquires an anatomical aspect closer to normal with the sutures.
 
After finishing corneal sutures, it’s critical to determine the extent of the injury. So, perform a gently conjunctival dissection to explore the sclera from anterior to posterior. It may be necessary to remove prolapsed vitreous also, but be careful about prolapsed uveal or retinal tissue. In this case the surgeon 8-0 non-absorbable Nylon sutures for the repair of posterior sclera. 
 
A Scleral laceration may either be located under the rectus muscles or it may extend under the muscles. In these cases the area can be exposed, lifting it out gently with a muscle hook, or sometimes, you may need to isolate the muscle with a 6-0 Vycril suture and cut it from the globe. After repair of the laceration, the muscle is resutured to its original insertion.

In this case the surgeon placed an anterior chamber infusion to restore the normal IOP and perform sutures review. In this moment you can change possible irregular sutures to keep watertight closure of all wounds. Iris hooks were placed and lens material was removed with a 25-G pars plana vitrector. 
 
After checking the position of the trocar, the infusion line was placed in the pars plana and the surgeon was able to perform PPV in the same procedure.
 
Despite the severity of the trauma, the patient didn´t have any retinal breaks. Even so,  PFCL was injected to stabilize a peripheral choroidal detachment and so the surgeon was able to perform the vitreous shaving safely.
 
In the end of the surgery iris sutures were performed, and after Fluid air exchange the silicone oil was implanted.

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a potentially devastating condition and surgical intervention is indicated when severe anterior chamber shallowing occurs, when there is a retinal detachment associated, severe ocular pain or in cases of kissing choroidals.
 
In this video we describe a technique for the drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 23-gauge transconjunctival trocar.
 
In this technique, it is not necessary to perform peritomy and 3mm scleral incisions like in the standard technique. In most cases, it’s not necessarily also performing PPV, and it is reserved only for cases of vitreous hemorrhage, Retinal Detachment and retinal incarceration. 
 
The goal of this procedure is to resolve kissing choroidals and flat AC and to remove blood from the macular region
 
Ultrasonography is used not only to document location and height of the detachment but also to determine proper timing for drainage by monitoring blood liquefaction. Intraoperative OCT was made showing a closed angle and flat anterior chamber before drainage.
 
First, an anterior chamber paracentesis is made to place a 23-gauge infusion line and to restore IOP. Even with the infusion, the OCT shows that the angle maintains closed yet.
The next step is to place a 23-gauge trocar/cannula system into the suprachoroidal space, creating a transconjunctival sclerotomy, 8 mm from the limbus at the most detached quadrant. (determined 1-2 days pre-operatively using B-scan ultrasonography). Ensure the Choroidal detachment is at least 5mm and determine the best drainage location with B-scan US.
 
In this figure we can see the correct technique with a incision toward equator 8mm from the limbus. Pars plana incisions are not recommended. Depending on the angle of entry, pars plana incisions can place the trocar into the vitreous cavity, with consequent not drainage, or even damaging the peripheral and/or posterior retina and choroid.

A Beveled incision is a key point, and it is critical not change the angle of entry. An angle of approximately 45º is best to penetrate the scleral arc without trauma in the choroid or retina.So, it’s necessary to avoid biplanar incisions. 
 
Here, an animation showing how perpendicular incisions can harm inadvertently other structures. However, too flat of an entry may lead to intra-scleral trocar placement instead of suprachoroidal.
There is a second key-point regarding the sclerotomy: You need to make a fast and controlled incision to place the trocar. 
 
The sclera seems to be softer when the choroid is detached, so it tends to move together with your trocar tip while you push the incision place. A controlled and fast incision with the eye well stabilized to avoid globe rotation it’s recommended.
 
It’s preferable to use non-valved cannulas, or alternatively you can maintain it open with forceps during drainage.
 
In this case, the surgeon placed a pars plana 23-gauge trocar and the detachment was monitorized with endoillumination. Intraoperative OCT shows that there´s no residual subretinal blood in macula, and after drainage, we can see in the OCT images that the angle was opened again

7_iKoXDDGmw,eyelid;scleral;vitrectomy;muscle;,Macular Buckling to treat Myopic Traction Maculopathy,"This is a video shared by Dr. Barbara Parolini from Brescia - Italy
 
In this video we discuss the use of macular buckling to treat myopic traction maculopathy and how to create one. We know that High Myopia and posterior staphiloma may have associated, complications like Myopic foveoschisis with or without Foveal detachment and Macular hole Retinal detachment.
 
Pathogenesis involves progression of the posterior staphyloma, anterior traction, intrinsic rigidity of the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Dr. Parolini is publishing on EJO a new Staging System, that identifies in one table of the stages of MTM, describing the evolution and the prognosis of the disease.
 
Macular Buckling a is a device designed to shorten the axial length of the eye at the posterior pole and have been successful in treating Myopic traction maculopathy associated or not with vitrectomy.  
 
Posterior Buckles of different shapes and materials have been proposed but there are only few commercially available. As they are not easily accessible in all countries Dr. Parolini describes how to make a Home-made model.
 
She proposes a L-Shaped macular Buckle made with a titanium stent, a 507 sponge and a Silicone sleeve. The titanium stent will be bent 90º in its final third. The sponge is cut about 1 cm in length and is placed on this extremity. Then, a 2 cm long silicone sleeve is used to cover the remaining area of the stent and so the total length of the buckle is 3 cm.

In this case a macular buckling is performed without vitrectomy. The first step of this procedure is performing a peritomy and tractions sutures in the superior and lateral rectus muscles. It’s important also, lowering the IOP by performing a paracentesis.
A twin lights fiber optics is used, one to be placed in pars plana and the other one inserted into the sponge inside the buckle. The device is inserted in the supero-temporal quadrant, either parallel to the lateral or to the superior rectus muscle so you are able to reach macula in any type of staphyloma. Then, you can check the correct position of the Buckle intraoperatively by using a panoramic viewing system.
When you reach the correct position, you mark the scleral positions to suture the buckle close to the insertion of the muscle (be careful about the thin sclera and risk of perforation in this location). It’s recommended at least two cross-mattress sutures to avoid tilt of the device.

You can see that the patient can improve not only the BCVA and the anatomical findings on the OCT, but also the microperimetry.
 
The ideal final shape of the posterior surface should be straight horizontal and not convex, at least in some scans (as shown in the pic below)
 
Here we can see that macular buckle doesn’t affect too much the esthetic of the eye and orbit and it only can be visualized by lifting the eyelid and moving the eye.

veVglUpZCcY,scleral;retinal;,Retinal Detachment: Giant Retinal Tear,"This is a case shared by Dr. Daniel Louzada from São Paulo – Brazil

This is a case of a patient with a inferior Giant Retinal Tear in his right eye. We can see also a PVR A in the border of the tear and the peripheral vitreous. 
In these cases, we normally don’t need to place a buckle, once the giant retinal tear works as a retinectomy.

It’s important perform radical excision removing as much as possible the vitreous base under scleral indentation. Heavy liquids are very useful in these cases once it helps to keep the flap down and to remove all the subretinal fluid.

A key point in this procedure is to remove all the fibrosed and folded border of the flap. You can use endocautery in this step to avoid or control bleeding.
In cases of giant tears, the retina in the area of the break may slip during PFCL removal creating retinal folds. You can avoid slippage by removing thoroughly the subretinal fluid during FAX.
Start removing PFCL until is just posterior to the edge of the break. Then keep your canula on the interface between BSS and PFCL. You can turn the eye away from the tear while aspirating the subretinal fluid. When the tear is completely dry, you can remove the remain PFCL over the optic disk.
If it doesn’t work, it’s possible to perform direct fluid against oil exchange.

FbE8RUUJIsk,conjunctival;anterior chamber paracentesis;retinal;,Suprachoroidal Buckle for Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment,"This is a video shared by Dr. Audrey Juan from Santo Domingo Dominican Republic

This is a case of a 35 years old Female with progressive decreased VA in OD in the last 2 months.
As ocular conditions, patient had a previous history of RRD in the left eye treated with Cryopexy and Scleral Buckle 12 years ago.

Her BCVA was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye.

In the Fundoscopy she had a macula Off Temporal retinal Detachment, with a single small hole superotemporally in the periphery.

Surgeon has decided to perform Suprachoroidal Buckle and Cryopexy for the treatment of this case. In this technique a cannula is guided in the suprachoroidal space to reach the target area and then a suprachoroidal filler is injected to create a temporary buckling to close retinal tears and supporting the overlying retina. 

A conjunctival peritomy was performed temporally in the side of the hole followed by cauterization of the sclera. Then she placed a Chandelier light so the Cryo could be done under BIOM visualization.  

An anterior chamber paracentesis was done to avoid increase of IOP during the suprachoroidal injection. Then a 3 mm incision was made 4 mm to the limbus, using a crescent blade to introduce the 23- Gauge Olive tip cannula. 

Olive Tip cannula is a curved cannula designed for suprachoroidal surgery. Note that the large and rounded tip allows gentle placement of filler material in the suprachoroidal space creating a buckle effect.

So, again under BIOM visualization, you can inject long-lasting Hyaluronic acid (Restylane) - that lasts about 2-3 months; or Viscoelastic (Healon GV or Healon 5) - that lasts 3-4 weeks. You can inject until to get the desired indentation. In the end of the surgery the sclera and conjunctiva are sutured.

This patient had a good outcome and three weeks after surgery, it was improvement in the VA and the indentation was still visible. The lesion was sealed, but there was yet a residual subretinal fluid in the posterior pole. Three months after the surgery retina was totally attached with adequate chorioretinal scaring.

As advantages, we can avoid potential problems of episcleral buckling, reducing refractive changings and postoperative discomfort with this technique.

LJoV830XGWk,scleral;retinal;,Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema Syndrome,"This is a video shared by Dr. Renato Rosário and Dr. André Maia from São Paulo Brazil.

This is a case of a 50 years old Male with recurrent vitreous hemorrhage and glaucoma in OD. As ocular conditions, patient had High Myopia, Dome-Shaped maculopathy and a previous history of RRD in the left eye. His BCVA was 20/40 in the right eye, the IOP was 19mmHg and in the slit-lamp examination patient had a 3-pieces IOL in the ciliary sulcus.

After further investigation the angiogram showed no areas of retinal ischemia and an UBM showed a haptic touching the ciliary body.

The diagnosis was Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema syndrome and pars plana vitrectomy and IOL removal was indicated.

Surgeon performed first a scleral sulcus and then 23-gauge trocars were inserted. It is interesting to see the endoscopy images that shows the contact between the IOL haptic and the ciliary body. It was probably the cause of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage in this case.

The IOL and the capsular complex were totally removed. Once patient had a IOL with zero power in the Biometry calculations, a new IOL implant was not programmed in this case. After removal, surgeon used the endoscopy to review vitreous base and the ciliary body. Using the endoscopy it is also possible to see the trabecular meshwork. 

To control better the intraocular pressure, an I-stent was implanted. In the end of the surgery, to avoid suteres, the tissue glue was used to close the conjunctiva.

VIXGxj-hv_8,scleral;retinal;,Retina Detachment: avoiding fish eggs during Perfluorocarbon Liquid injection,"In this video we discuss tips on Perfluorocarbon liquid injection

This is a case of Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in a psedophakic patient. During vitrectomy, we can see retinal breaks in the midperiphery inferiorly and superiorly.
The surgeon decided to use PFCL. Prior to filling, it’s important to make sure that all traction, especially in the retinal flaps, has been removed. 

Using a single-bore cannula, surgeon begin filling the eye over nasal side of the optic disk, keeping the cannula away from the fovea. However, during the injection we can note the formation of several bubbles in a process known as “fish eggs”. Small bubbles of PFCL are a risk for subretinal migration and it’s a phenomenon that can be avoided with some care.

To avoid Fish eggs, you can use a dual-bore cannula to inject PFCL while maintaining a constant intraocular pressure. That cannula provides an exit passageway for BSS and reduces resistance during injection.

Note in this other surgery, which Dual-bore was used how a single bubble of PFCL is formed. The injection speed should be sustained and gradual keeping the tip of the cannula always submerged while enlarging a single bubble.

If you do not have a Dual-bore cannula available, a single-bore cannula can be used, like in the first case, but ideally, keep the vitrector of a soft tip in the other hand, aspirating fluid while PFCL is being injected.

During scleral depression at the edge of PFCL, it’s important also to perform gently and slowly movements to avoid turbulence and PFCL bubbles migration into the break.

This patient had a poor outcome after cataract surgery with a dropped IOL and loss of capsular support. The surgical plan was vitrectomy,  Dropped IOL removal and  IOL fixation of an Akreos IOL with Goretex sutures.
Once patient had corneal oppacities and low corneal endothelial cell count, the surgeon decided avoid additional trauma in the anterior chamber and changed his plan.  Hashtag pattern sutures with Goretex were performed to create the IOL support. The dropped IOL was a non-foldable rigid PMMA IOL. So it was possible to position the IOL in the cilliary sulcus supported by the sutures.

Este paciente teve complicação de cirurgia de catarata com drop da LIO para a cavidade vítrea. O planejamento cirúrgico inicial era vitrectomia com remoção da LIO da cavidade vítrea e fixação escleral de uma nova lente (Akreos + Goretex). Uma vez que o paciente apresentava opacidades de córnea é contagem endotelial baixa, o cirurgião decidiu mudar o planejamento. Suturas com padrão de Hashtag foram realizadas para criar um suporte. Desta maneira, foi possível trazer a LIO não dobrável de PMMA que estava mergulhada para a câmara anterior e posteriormente posiciona-la no sulco ciliar sobre a sutura.

iRgsGgSBaaU,scleral;retinal;,Cryopexy for the management of Neovascular Glaucoma,"This is a case shared by Dr. Darko Batistic from Split Croatia.

This case is about a patient with retina ischemia and Neovascular Glaucoma secondary to proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.

In the ophthalmic examination he had uncontrolled IOP in the left eye despite correct topical treatment with antiglaucoma medication.
The gonioscopy showed neovascularization with an open angle and patient had corneal edema and small pupil even after mydriatic drugs. 
Patient had yet uncompleted Panretinal photocoagulation in the periphery.

To decrease concetration and inhibit production of intraocular VEGF an Bevacizumab injection was performed

To increase peripheral retinal coverage in this case we have some options:

Complete PRP in slit-lamp or indirect ophthalmoscope laser, but in this case with a small pupil it would be challeging. Performing pars plana vitrectomy and endolaser, it would be a option in this case, but as patient has Diabetic retinopathy, sometimes you prefer keep the vitreous so you can use Anti VEGF and Ozurdex in a safety and more predictable way. As an alternative the surgeon has decided performing Cryopexy using BIOM system, 4 weeks after the first Anti VEGF injection.
A peritomy was performed to protect gobllet cells and prevent postoperative chemosis. Then the surgeon places a chaldelier light and under BIOM visualization system transscleral Cryopexy were performed in 12 different spots 360º.
In the end of the surgery, after scleral sutures, a second Bevacizumab injection was performed

This patient had a good outcome with regression of iris and angle Neovascularization and normal IOP over 12 weeks. The gonioscopy showed yet an open angle during all the follow-up period.
 
Este é um caso de um paciente com isquemia retiniana e glaucoma neovascular secundário a Retinopatia diabética proliferativa.
No exame oftalmológico, ele apresentava aumento da PIO em olho esquerdo apesar do tratamento clínico para glaucoma. A gonioscopia mostrava neovasos mas o ângulo estava aberto, e o paciente apresentava edema corneano e dilatação pupilar pequena.
O mapeamento de retina mostrava Panfotocoagulação incompleta na periferia.
A fim de diminuir a concentração e inibir a produção de Anti VEGF, uma injeção de Bevacizumabe foi realizada. 

Para aumentar a cobertura do laser na periferia da retina neste caso temos algumas opções:

Podemos completar o laser na lâmpada de fenda ou com o oftalmoscópio indireto, mas neste caso a pupila miótica dificulta a realização. Realizar vitrectomia via pars plana com endolaser seria uma opção mas como o paciente é diabético, o cirurgião preferiu não remover o vítreo caso precisasse fazer Injeções com Anti VEGF e Ozurdex no futuro.
Como uma alternativa, o cirurgião decidiu realizar Criopexia com o auxílio do BIOM, 4 semanas após a injeção do Anti VEGF.

Foi realizado peritomia e o cirurgião colocou a Chandelier para usar o BIOM. A Crio transscleral foi então realizada na periferia em 12 pontos diferentes.

No final da cirurgiam após sutura escleral uma segunda dose de Bevacizumabe foi injetada.
Paciente teve bons resultados com regressão dos neovasos de íris e ângulo e com PIO normal ao longo de 12 semanas. A gonioscopia continuava com o ângulo aberto durante todo acompanhamento.

KD5p7xh98x8,scleral;retinal;muscle;,Surgical Management of a Suprachoroidal hemorrhage,"This is a case of an 81 years old, female patient that had suprachoroidal hemorrhage after complicated cataract surgery. During the procedure, patient had posterior capsular rupture and it was necessary performing PPV to remove lens fragments. In the end of the procedure, after IOL positioning in the ciliary sulcus, surgeon noticed loss of red reflex.
This patient had some risk factors for suprachoroidal hemorrhage and in this video we will discuss pearls on the management of this condition.

The blood is located between the sclera and the detached choroid, so, in these cases hemorrhages are removed from the scleral side and not transretinal. 

Surgical procedure was indicated in this case due to bullous detachment in both sides with kissing choroidals. There is no consensus about surgical time but usually it’s necessary wait 10 to 14 days to allow liquefaction of any clot prior to drainage.

So, the surgeon performed limbal peritomy and placed tractions sutures in the rectus muscles. Once pars plana epithelium is also detached, it’s difficult to insert the trocars You can use first an anterior chamber maintainer and the trocars can be inserted later when the choroidal detachment is reduced. With a blade, sclerotomies should be performed with 3-4mm in length and extend in radial direction. They are made between insertion of the muscle and the equator and placed inferiorly in the area of highest bullous choroidal detachment. Once the sclerotomy is performed, liquefied blood and blood clots will flow out the incision. You can help the extraction by compressing the globe with a forceps or cotton swabs.

After draining both inferior quadrants, the surgeon tried insert pars plana trocars, but it wasn’t possible to access the vitreous cavity yet. So, she decided to drain another quadrant superiorly and finally it was possible to insert infusion in the pars plana. 

Note that at this moment all trocars have a BSS flow.
We can note that the drainage of the inferotemporal quadrant was incomplete, with a residual choroidal detachment.
This patient had already been submitted to vitrectomy in the first surgery. There was small retained lens material that were removed and there wasn’t concurrent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

In the end of the surgery silicone oil was injected.  

Depending on the size of the sclerotomy an 8-0 Vycril sutures can be used to close the sclerotomy site although some surgeons prefer to leave the wound open to facilitate addicional drainage.

A hemorragia nestes casos está localizada entre a esclera e a coroide descolada, portanto, o sangue deve ser removido pela esclera e não através da retina.

O procedimento cirúrgico de drenagem do DC hemorrágico neste caso foi indicado devido a um descolamento bolhoso bilateral com kissing de coroide. Não há consenso sobre o tempo ideal para realizar a cirurgia, mas é geralmente necessário esperar cerca de 10 a 14 dias para que os coágulos estejam liquefeitos no momento da drenagem.

A cirurgiã realizou peritomia limbar e fez a pexia dos músculos retos. Uma vez que o epitélio da pars plana está também descolado nestes casos, é difícil inserir os trocaters nesta via. Você pode realizar primeiro a infusão na câmara anterior e os trocateres podem ser colocados na pars plana depois que o DC estiver menor. Com uma lâmina de bisturi, esclerotomias radiais de aproximadamente 3-4mm são realizadas entre a inserção dos músculos retos e o equador. Estas incisões devem ser feitas abaixo da área de maior bolsão do DC.

Uma vez que a esclerotomia tenha sido feita, o sangue liquefeito e os coágulos devem sair pela incisão. Você pode usar um fórceps ou cotonetes para comprimir a incisão e ajudar na drenagem.
 
Após drenar os quadrantes inferiores, a cirurgião tenta colocar os trocateres via pars plana, mas o DC ainda não permite acesso a cavidade vítrea. Então ela decide drenar um quadrante superior também e finalmente consegue inserir a infusão e os trocateres na pars plana.
Note que neste momento, todos os trocateres tem fluxo de BSS

Nós podemos notar que a drenagem do quadrante temporal inferior foi incompleta e ainda havia DC residual. Este paciente já tinha submetido a vitrectomia na primeira cirurgia e tinha somente pequenos fragmentos de cristalino na cavidade vítrea que foram removidos. Não haviam roturas e nem áreas de retina regmatogênico.  

No final da cirurgia o óleo de silicone foi injetado.
Dependendo do tamanho da esclerotomia, suturas de Vycril 8-0 podem ser usadas para fechar as incisões feitas. Alguns cirurgiões preferem não fechá-las para que a incisão continue ajudando na drenagem no pós operatório imediato.

gjx5vHrdD1c,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Complications on IOL Scleral Fixation surgery,"In this video we show a complication of IOL scleral fixation surgery and its management to achieve a good outcome.

In this surgery, an Akreos IOL (Baush Lomb) is sutured into the sclera with GoreTex sutures in four-points technique. As advantages this technique provides good IOL centralization and handling GoreTex sutures are much easier than Prolene sutures
In the end of the fixation, the GoreTex sutures had better keep into the sclera to avoid exposed sutures. So, after positioning the IOL, the surgeon grasps the sutures in the scleral flaps in all 4 points of fixation.

The complication in this case occurs at the end of procedure, when the surgeon is positioning the last suture under the scleral flap to leave the sutures in the intrascleral space. These complications illustrate how tricky IOL scleral fixation surgeries can be and how it is necessary to focus on the details of each step until the end of the surgery.
With the loss of the suture, the surgeon had to decide whether to remove the implanted IOL or improvise to perform an intraocular suture.
GoreTex suture was then passed again through the inferotemporal incision and with the help of retinal forceps and a 30-gauge needle the surgeon could suture the eylets intraocularly without removing the IOL.

This procedure is a good option for solving this kind of complication and also for managing redislocation of an IOL in eyes previously submitted to scleral fixation techniques using prolene sutures for example.

Título: Complicações em cirurgia de fixação escleral

Neste vídeo nós mostramos uma complicação da cirurgia de fixação escleral com Goretex e o manejo da mesma.
Nesta cirurgia, uma lente intraocular Akreos (Baush Lomb) foi suturada na esclera em 4 pontos de fixação usando o Goretex. Esta técnica permite boa centralização da LIO e o manejo do Goretex no intraoperatório é muito mais fácil em comparação com as suturas de Prolene. 
No final da fixação, o fio deve ficar intraescleral para evitar exposição da sutura. Portanto, após o posicionamento correto da LIO o cirurgião puxa as suturas nos flaps esclerais em todos os 4 pontos de fixação para finalmente nodar a sutura.

Neste caso, a complicação ocorre no final do procedimento, quando o cirurgião está posicionando a última sutura abaixo do flap escleral. Ao puxar o fio, a outra metade que já estava na posição correta é puxada também e o cirurgião perde a sutura de um dos lados.
Esta complicação ilustra como a cirurgia de fixação escleral é difícil e como é necessário focar em todos os detalhes de cada passo cirúrgico até o final do procedimento.
Com a perda da sutura, o cirurgião precisou decidir entre remover a LIO já implantada e começar novamente a fixação, ou tentar fixar a lente dentro da cavidade vítrea. A sutura de Goretex foi então passada novamente através da incisão temporal inferior e com a ajuda de um fórceps de retina e uma agulha 30 – gauge foi possível fixar os hápticos da LIO na cavidade vítrea, sem precisar remover a LIO.

Este procedimento é uma boa opção para resolver este tipo de complicação e serve também para manejar lentes eventualmente redeslocadas por cirurgias de fixação escleral prévia em outras técnicas.

JBIo3Lu7wOE,scleral;retinal;,Pneumatic Retinopexy and the Steamroller technique,"This is a case of a recent RRD in a pseudophakic patient. Patient had only one horseshoe-shaped tear at 2 o’clock, macula wasn’t affected yet, but the operating room wasn’t available for vitrectomy in this day. So the surgeon decided perform pneumatic retinopexy and between all options of gases for this procedure, was used 0.5ml of pure SF6. Before the gas injection a paracentesis was performed. Once the retinal break was temporal, the injection was programmed nasally 0.3mm from the limbus.

PR can be done in one session, with cryopexy applied to the retinal breaks just before gas injection, or as a two-session procedure, with initial gas injection followed by laser photocoagulation 1 or 2 days later.

For the injection, the 30-gauge needle is directed toward the center of the vitreous and inserted to depth of 7 or 8 mm. Then it is partially withdrawn leaving only 3mm inside the globe. With the needle position uppermost and vertically, the gas is injected evenly and moderately briskly to create one single bubble. Following these steps, you can avoid multiple small bubbles often referred as “fish eggs.

Steamroller Technique can avoid macular detachment after gas injection when the fluid extends and threat the posterior pole. After the injection, the gas bubble tends to push the subretinal fluid to the macular region. Iatrogenic macular detachment is prevented by placing the patient in the face-down position immediately following gas injection. It allows subretinal fluid to pass through the break into the vitreous.
Over 10 minutes, the patient’s head position is very gradually moved along the meridian between the macula and the retinal break until the retinal break is uppermost. In this case retina tear was treated by laser photocoagulation in the next day.

Pneumatic Retinopexy is a good option to treat selected RD cases and it is a less invasive and less expensive procedure comparing with scleral Buckling and vitrectomy

_______________________________________________________________

Retinopexia Pneumática e a manobra de Steamroller

Neste vídeo mostramos um caso de descolamento de retina regmatogênico em um paciente pseudofácico. Paciente tinha rotura única em ferradura as 2 horas, com mácula ainda colada. No dia da consulta, por ser véspera de Natal, o centro cirúrgico estava indisponível para realização de vitrectomia via pars plana. Pensando em evitar evolução do quadro e envolvimento macular, o cirurgião indicou Retinopexia Pneumática, que foi realizada no mesmo dia.

O vídeo mostra uma tabela sobre os gases, doses e as expansões esperadas para uso na Retinopexia pneumática:

Intravitreal gas Duration and Expansion:
Gas dose Duration  Largest Size Expansion
Air 0.8ml 4 days  Immediate No expansion 
SF6 0.5ml 12 days         36 hours Doubles 
C3F8 0.3ML 38 days 3 days  Quadruples

Nesta caso, foi usado o SF6 a 100% (0.5ml) e antes da injeção foi realizada uma paracentese de câmara anterior. 
A RP pode ser feita em uma sessão, com aplicação de criopexia na rotura logo antes da aplicação do gás, ou em 2 sessões, com realização de fotocoagulação a laser 1 ou 2 dias após.

Para a injeção do gás, uma agulha de 30-Guage é inserida, na direção do centro da cavidade vítrea em uma profundidade de 7-8mm. Então ela deve ser removida parcialmente até que fique somente com 3mm dentro do olho e posicionada na parte mais superior. O gás então deve ser injetado de maneira continua e com pressão moderada e regular (evitando fazer com muita força). Seguindo está técnica você pode evitar a formação de várias bolhas (conhecida como “fish eggs”)

A técnica de Steamroller é usada para evitar que o DR progrida para a região macular após a injeção do gás.  Após a injeção, a bolha de gás tende a empurrar o fluido para a região do pólo posterior. O descolamento iatrogênico da macula pode ser evitado colocando o paciente em face-down logo após a injeção. Desta maneira, o gás protege a macula e fica no polo posterior e empurra o fluido do DR para a cavidade vítrea através da rotura. Ao longo de cerca de 10 minutos, a cabeça do paciente é gradualmente posicionada ao longo do meridiano entre a mácula e a rotura de maneira que no final, está fique na posição mais superior. 

A retinopexia pneumática é uma técnica menos cara e invasiva para o tratamento de casos selecionados de descolamento de retina

In this video we discuss the management of IOFB. 
This patient had penetrant ocular trauma with metallic IOFB retained in the posterior segment. The foreign body entered through the limbus and the lens was not involved
The first step in the surgery was to perform phacoemulsification, without IOL implant. Then, a standard 3-port vitrectomy was performed to remove the FB. 
Triamcinolone was injected to help the posterior hyaloid detachment and the vitreous base was shaved to facilitate the foreign body removal.
To avoid further damage, hypotony and large sclerotomies, the surgeon decided to perform posterior capsulotomy and the IOFB was dragged to the anterior chamber with a help of a retinal forceps.
So, through an enlarged corneal incision the IOFB was removed
In the end of the surgery a 3-pieces IOL was implanted in the ciliary sulcus.
In these cases it’s important to perform a careful peripheral examination under scleral depression to treat any retina tear.

In this series of videos, we will discuss the pros and cons of the main techniques used for IOL fixation.

In this video we discuss the pros and cons of Yamane Technique 

Yamane technique was described in 2014 and since then has been increasing in popularity. 

The technique involves externalizing the haptics of a 3-pieces IOL using a double needle technique, and a cautery is used to form a button-like tip at the end of each haptic.

The haptics are placed intrascleral and there is no need to use sutures or glue.

However, it´s not an easy surgery especially for beginners and there is an ultrathin line between success and failure.

Complications like IOL tilt, decentration, damage in the haptic and conjunctival erosion have been described associated with this technique and the choice of the correct IOL and needle has key points in the results. 

The advantages of this techniques are that it could be performed with few incisions, the surgical time (quicker than other scleral and iris fixation techniques) and the fact that we don’t need to suture or to use glue.

The technique allows also implantation of a foldable IOL through a small corneal incision and the eyes tend to have little postoperative inflammation with fast visual rehabilitation

The disadvantages of this technique are:

-       The concept of the surgery is quite simple, but it is a challenging technique 
-       Details like choose of the correct IOL and needle, angulation of the incisions are critical to get good results.
-       Intraoperative technical difficulties handling the haptics can lead to distortion and consequently tilt or IOL decentration
-       Possibility of long-term complications like conjunctival erosion and haptic extrusion can be listed as a disadvantage also

63sTwEVLnhA,conjunctival;scleral;vitrectomy;,IOL fixations Techniques: Pros and Cons – Goretex sutures,"In the absence of capsular support, the retina surgery is faced with a number of choices for implantation of an IOL. Several techniques have been described for fixation of an IOL either to the iris or the sclera in the ciliary sulcus.
The technique choice is variable regarding preferences of the surgeons and particularities from the patient. We don’t have the answer about which is the better technique for IOL implant.

In this series of videos, we will discuss the pros and cons of the main techniques used for IOL fixation.

In this video we discuss the pros and cons of the use of Goretex sutures to perform four-point fixation with scleral pockets.

Unlike other scleral fixation techniques, in this surgery, it is possible to fix an Akreos IOL without opening the conjunctiva to expose the sclera.

Instead, the surgeon makes two limbal scleroconjunctival incisions at 3 and 9 o'clock to later perform the scleral pockets. A crescent blade is used for this step.

To create the scleral pockets is a challenge step in the surgery once the angulation of the crescent blade makes difficult the adequate visualization. You can move the eye laterally to improve the incision control.

It’s important also to extent the size of the pockets laterally so that it acquires a fan shape.

This way, the two points of fixation from each side will be placed 2mm from the limbus and 4 mm apart. The superior points of each side can be the same places of the trocars used for the posterior vitrectomy.

After completing the posterior vitrectomy and to perform dropped IOL removal, the Goretex suture is inserted through the inferior point in one side and grasped through a corneal incision. So, the suture is passed through the Akreos eylets, up and down, and then is inserted again in the corneal incision and removed through the superior trocar in the same side.

The same steps are repeated in the other side to complete four point of fixation and then the IOL is implanted.

In the end, the surgeon grasps the Goretex sutures to place then into the pockets and after the adjustment, the Akreos IOL is sutured intrasclerally.


The advantages of this technique are:

Goretex sutures have higher tensile strength and you don’t expect complications like later breakage as described in Prolene sutures. Goretex sutures have yet better visibility (due to your white color) and is much easier to manipulate intraoperatively.

This technique has also an effective centralization, once Akreos and the 4 points of sutures allow excellent stability.

Another advantage is great postoperative comfort for the patient once conjunctival sutures don’t need to be performed.


Although the literature describes the safety of intraocular use of Goretex, with follow-up periods longer than 10 years, it is still considered off-label. Another disadvantages that can be listed is higher surgical time and the technical difficult to perform the scleral pockets.

In this series of videos, we will discuss the pros and cons of the main techniques used for IOL fixation.

This video was shared by Dr. Sérgio Canabrava from Belo Horizonte - Brazil
In this video we discuss the pros and cons of the 4 Flanged intrascleral fixation -  Canabrava Technique.

The first steps of this procedure are to pass the 6.0 Prolene through a corneal incision and removing it bilaterally through the scleral using a 29 Gauge needle to assist. As following, surgeon pass the sutures through the Akreos eylets, up and down in each side. 

In the third step, the surgeon grasps the Prolene suture with a 29-gauge needle in one side and then with a Burrata Forceps the folded Akreos is inserted through a 3.4mm corneal incision. Note although that the second piece of the Prolene is yet outside of the eye at this moment. It is important in order to not let the wire crisscross inside the eye. After adjusting the IOL in the correct position, the other side of the suture is also docked in a 29-gauge needle completing the 4 points of fixation into the sclera. So, the first two flanges are created in the inferior sutures bilaterally using a cautery. It’s important do not flange the superior points yet, so you can perform a correct tension in the sutures and to position the IOL better. After the adjustment, the surgeon finally proceeds the last 2 flanges superiorly and place the sutures in the subconjunctival space.

The advantages of this technique are Good centralization (once you have 4 points of fixation). Large sclerocorneal incision is not necessary in this technique

On label use of intraocular Prolene sutures and the lower cost once Prolene is cheaper than Goretex / Akreos is cheaper than Artisan can also be listed as advantages

As disvantages we have longer surgical time, and the fact that it is a new technique and the long-term results and complications like redislocation and conjunctival extrusion are still unknown

Several techniques have been described for fixation of an IOL either to the iris or the sclera in the ciliary sulcus.

The technique choice is variable regarding preferences of the surgeons and particularities from the patient. We don’t have the answer about which is the better technique for IOL implant. 

In this series of videos, we will discuss the pros and cons of the main techniques used for IOL fixation.

This video was shared by Dr. Caio Franco from São Paulo Brazil.

In this video we describe a technique of retropupillary IOL Artisan fixation and discuss the pros and cons of this procedure. The surgery begins opening the conjunctiva and performing a dissection of a 5.5mm scleral tunnel once Artisan isn’t a foldable IOL.

The frown incision is located perpendicularly with the intended claws axis. In this case the IOL enclavation was programed to 3 and 9 o’clock and then the scleral tunnel was made at 12 o’clock. An anterior vitrectomy is important before removing the dislocated IOL to avoid traction and peripheral breaks.

After removing the IOL and capsular complex, the surgeon performed 2 short paracenteses at 3 and 9 o’clock and then he completed the posterior vitrectomy.

Artisan IOL can be implanted anterior or behind the pupil. For retropupillary implantation, like in this case, it’s important to place the IOL “upside down” because the haptics are bent upward. There are also different A-constants for anterior or retropupillary IOL implantation.

The surgeon used an ARTISAN implantation forceps to grasp the IOL and place it in the retropupillary plane. Then he moves the IOL upward against the iris to facilitate enclavation

As Advantages, this technique has the short surgical time; sutureless implantation and the good centralization once both haptics are in the iris plane. Another pro is about stability once IOL redislocation is an unusual complication in this technique.

The disvantages are: hypotony during vitrectomy once you have to open a large sclerocorneal incision. Another disvantage is that the IOL is fixated in the iris tissue and it may lead to inflammation postoperatively.

Several techniques have been described for fixation of an IOL either to the iris or the sclera in the ciliary sulcus.

The technique choice is variable regarding preferences of the surgeons and particularities from the patient. We don’t have the answer about which is the better technique for IOL implant. 



In this series of videos, we will discuss the pros and cons of the main techniques used for IOL fixation.



The first video describes a technique of Scleral fixation using 10-0 Prolene sutures. There is a great variation of this technique, but in this case a 3-pieces IOL (Alcon MA60AC) is fixated in the sclera using cow-hitch sutures.  This patient was submitted to lensectomy and PPV after traumatic dislocation of the lens. The surgical plan was to use an Alcon MA60AC IOL sutured into the scleral through a four-point fixation technique which allow good centralization.



In this technique we enter first in the nasal scleral flap 2mm to the limbus, in the inferior region and the straight needle of the Prolene is grasped through a corneal incision at 12 o’clock. Then the same needle is inserted back through the corneal incision and is docked with a 30-gauge needle in the superior region of the same flap.



Then the same steps are repeated on the temporal side so that you have two 



Prolene loops coming out of the corneal incision.



The Cow-Hitch technique allows you suture the haptics using the IOL-injector, so you don’t need to open large corneal incision. It’s important to try to keep the suture right in the middle of the haptic so you can avoid IOL tilt. After the insertion the IOL in the anterior chamber the second haptic is sutured.



As advantages of this approach we have small corneal incision (once a foldable IOL is used) and 4 points scleral fixation technique that allows better centralization. Another pro is that Prolene sutures are used intraocularly for many years and it is approved for this purpose.



The Disadvantages of this technique are the possibility of late redislocation due to tissue erosion (described after years in Prolene sutures). The time consuming and the difficulty handling 10-0 Prolene sutures are disadvantages as well. Furthermore, there are possibility of Lens tilt causing high astigmatism postoperatively. To avoid this be careful to keep the cow-hitch suture in the middle of the haptic bilaterally.

RoDsxf9YotY,glaucoma surgery;vitrectomy;,Vitrectomy pearls: Releasable sutures,"This week on the Retina Tips we will discuss a technique for releasable sutures that can occasionally be used in vitreoretinal surgeries

This technique was discussed recently in the 2019 EURETINA meeting in Paris and I will show a case with some modifications. 

The indication of sclerotomies sutures is variable and related with surgeon’s preferences but like in this case, when you have any evidence of leakage you should definitely to perform sutures.

In this case we performed a releasable suture with 7-0 Vicryl sutures to be easily removed in the slit lamp in the next day. The idea is to avoid hypotony in the first day, and also, the unnecessary chronic inflammation in conjunctiva related to Vicryl sclerotomies sutures that persist for 5 or 6 weeks after the surgery. 
These sutures don’t need to be left so long once it is cause of discomfort and pain.

This technique consists in two slipknots easily releasable. You first perform two turns around in the forceps and make the first knot. The second knot is identical to the first but in the opposite direction.
Final aspect of the knot is similar with a shoelace or a butterfly.

In our surgery a 7-0 Vicryl with spatulated needle was used. The authors suggest that this technique be performed with 9-0 monofilament Vicryl with round needle in order to minimize the trauma of the suture.

In our case the sutures were removed in the first day postoperatively. The sutures are removed in the next day in most cases. In cases which silicone oil was used the authors suggest removing it only 4 days postoperatively

duMZyJlqCWc,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Intraocular lens scleral fixation: Pearls on Yamane Technique,"This is a video shared by Dr. Ricardo Chagas from Salvador Brazil.

One popular approach to place intraocular lens in the absence of adequate capsular support is the Yamane Technique. This technique involves externalizing the haptics of the IOL using a double needle technique, and then a cautery is used to form a button-like tip at the end of each haptic. 
The advantages of this technique are that we do not need to use sutures or glue, we do fewer incisions, and the surgery use to be quicker and less invasive comparing to the other scleral and iris fixation techniques. However, it´s not an easy surgery for beginners and there is some key points to be listed to avoid complications like tilt or decentration on the IOL, damage in the haptic and scleral haptic extrusion.
 
In this video we discuss some pearls and key steps to improve the results and avoid complications in this technique.
 
1 – The first tip is to use the toric marker to set the positions where the haptics will be grasped through the sclera. This way you can achieve proper centration and better effective lens position. Make also two marks in conjunctiva in each side, 2mm from the limbus and 2mm apart. 

2 – The second tip is related to the IOL choice 
You can use either a three-pieces IOL, Zeiss CT Lucia 602 or Sensar AR40. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) haptics (CT Lucia 602) are more malleable and resistant than Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) haptics (Sensar AR60) so you can prevent erosion through the conjunctiva using the correct IOL.
 
3 – Using the right needle for the procedure is also a key step 
Due to the diameter of the haptics, the inner lumen of the needle must be large enough. The 30-Gauge thin-walled TSK needle is described in the Yamane Technique, but this needle is not commercially available in many countries. As an alternative you can use 27-Gauge although it would require the use of larger scleral tunnel wound. Don’t use standard-bore 30-Gauge needle available in the most surgical centers. This is not an option for this technique.
 
In this video the surgeon injected the IOL in the anterior chamber and then he used a 27-Gauge needle and retinal forceps to dock the haptics bilaterally. Then, after externalizing the haptics he performed the flange using a cautery.

ujTLwfDMV2Y,scleral;retinal;,Retinal detachment: 360º prophylactic photocoagulation in uncomplicated cases (vitrectomy),"This is a case of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment shared by Dr. Caio Franco (@retina.vitreo) from São Paulo - Brazil 
In this video we can see an uncomplicated RRD case which was indicated primary vitrectomy. Trimming of the vitreous skirt showed several retinal breaks in all quadrants and then the surgeon decided to perform 360º endolaser photocoagulation 
Adjuvant procedures associated with vitrectomy like the use of heavy liquids, scleral buckling and 360º photocoagulation can help to achieve good anatomical outcomes in selected cases,
But should these procedures be performed routinely?
Lots of surgeons perform 360º endolaser in all cases, expecting to treat missed retinal breaks, or to prevent new breaks postoperatively.

The Retina Society discussed a recent comparative series which the use of 360º photocoagulation had no improvement in single-surgery success rate.

This group had lower final anatomical success and worse final VA
They recommend that careful search of missed retinal breaks is preferred to routine scleral buckling or 360º laser.
The study shows yet that you have to expose 33 patients to morbidity and cost of adjuvant procedures in order to prevent 1 recurrent RD.

PPV without the 360° peripheral endolaser can provide successful anatomic outcomes and this procedure should be perform only in selected cases

Título: Descolamento de retina: o papel da fotocoagulação profilática 360º em casos não complicados
Este é um caso de descolamento regmatogênico de retina compartilhado por Dr. Caio Franco (@ retina.vitreo) de São Paulo - Brasil
Neste vídeo, podemos ver um caso de descolamento de retina regmatogênico não complicado no qual foi indicado vitrectomia primária. A vitrectomia da base mostrou várias roturas em região periférica, em todos os quadrantes, e o cirurgião decidiu realizar a fotocoagulação periférica em 360º. 
Procedimentos adjuvantes associados à vitrectomia, como o uso de líquidos pesados, Buckle, e fotocoagulação 360º, podem ajudar a obter bons resultados anatômicos em casos selecionados, mas esses procedimentos devem ser executados rotineiramente?
Muitos cirurgiões realizam endolaser 360º em todos os casos, esperando tratar buracos ou roturas retinianas não visualizadas na vitectomia, ou impedir novas roturas no pós-operatório.
Retina Society discutiu uma série comparativa recentemente em que o uso da fotocoagulação 360º não  mostrou aumento na taxa de sucesso em um único procedimento. O Grupo do laser 360º inclusive teve menor sucesso anatômico final e pior AV final

Eles recomendam que a pesquisa cuidadosa de roturas retinianas sob indentação escleral (revisão da base vítrea) deve ser realizada preferencialmente ao laser profilático 360º.
O estudo mostra ainda que é necessário expor 33 pacientes à morbidade e custo dos procedimentos adjuvantes para evitar 1 descolamento de retina  recorrente.
Vitrectomia via pars plana sem o endolaser periférico 360° tem resultados anatômicos e funcionais bons e o laser profilático deve ser realizado apenas em casos selecionados.

Patient with history of penetrating ocular trauma in the right eye, about 1 year ago. On the day of trauma, the patient was submitted to corneal suture and shortly thereafter, pars plana vitrectomy with vegetal intraocular foreign body removal. Since the patient had retinal tears in the first surgery, endolaser was performed and silicone oil was left as substitute. In this third surgery, the patient was submitted to silicone oil removal, scleral fixation of Intraocular Lens (Goretex CV-8 and Akreos - Baush Lomb).
The cornea team came together to perform penetrating keratoplasty.
 
Tip - It can be noted that at the beginning of the surgery it is not possible to evaluate well the retinal base due to pupillary membranes. The surgeon placed the infusion initially in the anterior chamber until he was able to remove the pupillary membranes. Subsequently, the inferior temporal sclerotomy 23 Gauge is performed, and now with better visualization the surgeon was able to place the infusion in the pars plana and check its correct position.

Esse é um vídeo compartilhado por Dra Tatiana Prazeres (Córnea) e Dr. Filipe Lucatto (Retina)
Paciente com história prévia de trauma ocular penetrante em olho direito há cerca de 1 ano. Foi submetido no dia do trauma a sutura corneana e logo em seguida a vitrectomia via pars plana com remoção de corpo estranho intraocular (vegetal). Como apresentava roturas retinianas na primeira cirurgia, foi realizado endolaser e deixado óleo de silicone como substituto vítreo.
Nesta segunda vitrectomia o paciente foi submetido a remoção do óleo de silicone, fixação escleral  de Lente intraocular (Goretex CV-8 e Lente intraocular Akreos - Baush Lomb). A equipe de córnea entrou em conjunto para realização de transplante penetrante.
 
Tip - podemos notar que no início da cirurgia não é possível avaliar bem a base retiniana devido a membranas pupilares. O cirurgião coloca a infusão inicialmente na câmara anterior até conseguir abrir as membranas pupilares. Na sequência, é colocada a esclerotomia 23 G temporal inferior e agora com maior transparência de meios o cirurgião é capaz de colocar a infusão na pars plana e conferir a localização correta da mesma.

DBSQGYIZiVo,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Scleral fixation using Slip-knot sutures - Author: Filipe Lucatto MD,"Video presented in the Video Competition session in EURETINA 2019 (Paris).

In this video we describes a technique of scleral fixation using Slip-Knot sutures.

This patient had a poor outcome after cataract surgery and a single-piece PMMA IOL was dislocated to the vitreous cavity. Inicially it was programed a vitrectomy to exchange the IOL, removing it through a scleral tunnel and performing a scleral fixation of a new IOL. 

It was used a CV-8 Gore-Tex suture inserting it through a corneal incision and grasping it through a 23 Gauge sclerotomy 3mm inferotemporal to the limbus. Another sclerotomy was performed also 3mm to the limbus and 3mm apart to the first one. So the another tip of the Gore-Tex was grasped through it forming temporal loop. Then, the surgeon performs a kind of a sliding knot that allows one of the haptic of the IOL to be tied in the vitreous cavity. First it was performed the Slip-knot suture, and then the node was inserted into the eye through the anterior chamber. After being positioned in the middle of the haptic, the surgeon slides the knot and locks it using two retinal forceps. The same surgical steps are repeated on the nasal side to perform the scleral fixation of the other IOL haptic. After tying both haptics we can pull the Gore-Tex sutures bilaterally to perform IOL centralization. 

This is an interesting technique to fix an IOL without having to remove it from the inside of the eye, avoiding additional trauma to a patient who has had poor outcome from cataract surgery. 

This technique can be used for any IOL known to be securely placed in the ciliary sulcus and can minimize the surgical trauma to the iris, corneal endothelium, and to reduce the risks of intraoperative hypotony during scleral fixation surgeries. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Vídeo apresentado no EURETINA 2019 (Video Competition - Paris).

Neste vídeo, descrevemos uma técnica de fixação escleral usando suturas em Slip-Knot.

Este paciente teve complicações durante a cirurgia de catarata e uma LIO PMMA de peça única deslocou-se para a cavidade vítrea. Inicialmente, foi programada uma vitrectomia para troca da lente intraocular (LIO), removendo a lente luxada por um túnel escleral e realizando a fixação escleral de uma nova LIO. Durante a cirurgia porém, a programação foi trocada e decidimos realizar fixação da lente que estava na cavidade vítrea

Foi utilizada suturas de Gore-Tex CV-8, inserindo o mesmo através de uma abertura na córnea e puxando por uma esclerotomia 23 Gauge a 3 mm inferotemporal ao limbo. Outra esclerotomia foi realizada também a 3 mm do limbo e a 3 mm de distância da primeira. Assim, a outra ponta do Gore-Tex foi puxada através dela, formando uma alça temporal. Em seguida, o cirurgião realiza uma espécie de nó deslizante que permite que um dos hápticos da LIO seja amarrado na própria cavidade vítrea com a ajuda de duas pinças de retina. Primeiramente, foi realizado o Slip-knot, e em seguida, o nó foi inserido no olho através da câmara anterior e jogado para a cavidade vítrea. Após ser posicionado no meio do háptico, o cirurgião desliza o nó e o fixa usando dois fórceps  de retina. As mesmas etapas cirúrgicas são repetidas no lado nasal para realizar a fixação escleral do outro háptico da LIO. Depois de amarrar os dois hápticos, podemos puxar as suturas de Gore-Tex bilateralmente para realizar a centralização e posicionamento da LIO.

Essa é uma técnica interessante para fixação escleral da lente intra ocular sem a necessidade de removê-la do interior do olho. Com isso evitamos traumas adicionais para um paciente que teve um desfecho ruim após cirurgia de catarata (danos no endotélio e outras estruturas da câmara anterior).

Essa técnica pode ser usada para qualquer LIO que possa ser colocada com segurança no sulco ciliar, e pode minimizar o trauma cirúrgico da íris, endotélio da córnea e reduzir os riscos de hipotonia intraoperatória durante cirurgias de fixação escleral.

The surgeon performed scleral fixation using a modified Yamane Technique.

The first tip is to set the position of corneal incision and the places where the haptics will be grasped through scleral in a virtual T position. The surgeon set a virtual T at 45º and 225º for the haptic positions and a corneal incision at 135º. The first needle was inserted 2 mm to the limbus in the 45º position.

The second tip is to insert the first haptic directely in the needle lumen. 
Using this suggested position surgeon are able to use your left hand to hold the neddle and your right hand to manage the haptic inside the AC. A bipolar cautery was used to flange creation.

The second needle was inserted at 225º position and with a retinal forceps the second haptic was inserted into the needle.

Este é um caso de subluxação do cristalino em que o cirurgião realizou cirurgia de vitrectomia via pars plana, cominada com facoemulsificação do cristalino e fixação escleral da lente intraocular.
O cirurgião realizou a fixação escleral com a técnica de Yamane modificada.
A primeira dica desta técnica é programar a posição da incisão corneana principal e os locais onde os hapticos da LIO serão puxados através da esclera, de maneira que eles formem virtualmente um ""T"" . O cirurgião neste caso programou as posições dos hápticos a 45º e 225º e a incisão corneana a 135º. A primeira agulha pe então inserida 2mm do limbo na posição de 45º.
A segunda dica é inserir o primeiro háptico diretamente no lúmen da agulha. Usando as posições sugeridas acima, o cirurgião pode usar a mão esquerda para segurar a agulha e a mão direita para manejar o háptico dentro da câmara anterior.  Um cautério bipolar foi usado para realizar o flange na ponta do háptico.
A segunda agulha foi então inserida na posição de 225º e com uma pinça de retina o segundo háptico foi inserido no lúmen da agulha.
A técnica modificada de Yamane é útil para diminuir manipulações dos hápticos e evitar complicações como danificações aos mesmo (quebra ou distorções). Usando as posições sugeridas o cirurgião faz os passos mais difíceis com a mão direita, e usa a mão esquerda para segurar a agulha. Pode ser adaptada conforme a lateralidade de cada cirurgião.

cNQcqMYuy_c,scleral;phaco;retinal;,Surgical management of a dropped nucleus with PFCL - Author: Yurdacan Demir MD,"In this video we will discuss a technique to approach a dropped nucleus using PFCL to bring it to the anterior chamber to remove it with phacoemulsification.
 
The first step is to remove the vitreous core and all membranes in the pupil and anterior chamber. 
You can perform this steps with the microscope light (without wide-angle system). If necessary, you can turn off the microscope light and use the Chandelier or endoillumination for better visualization of the posterior lens capsule and to avoid damaging the residual capsule support. 

Posterior hyaloid detachment maneuver is more difficult in the presence of large nucleus in the posterior pole but adequate vitreous removal is critical to prevent iatrogenic breaks.
   
So, surgeon injects PFCL to fill the vitreous cavity and until bring the nucleus to the pupillary plane. Sometimes the fragment keeps behind the iris and so, you can use a scleral depressor to help place it in the correct position. It´s important to use valved system, or place a plugs in the the trocars to avoid leakage, PFCL loss or nucleus swirling.

Use phaco hand piece to remove the nucleus. If possible, try do not break the nucleus in several pieces to avoid that they dropped again to the vitreous cavity. You can both use a viscoelastic behind the nucleus and use the endoillumination probe via pars plana to support and maintain the fragments into the anterior chamber.

It´s important to review vitreous bases to remove all fragments and to treat an eventual retinal break.
If the anterior support is intact, you can place a 3-pieces IOL in the cilliary sulcus.

lChAQjuLVHE,scleral;retinal;,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy - Author: Filipe Lucatto MD,"In this video we discuss tips about vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vitrectomy for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is one of the most challenging vitreoretinal surgeries.
We´ve listed some tips about management of this cases:

1 - The posterior hyaloid is usually attached to the retina with fibrovascular membranes in these cases. The surgeon needs to take the utmost care to avoid causing unnecessary retinal tears or bleedings.
So, try to find where the peripheral vitreous is detached, and perform a circumferential rhexis begining from the mid-periphery (from the periphery to the center).  Try to perform a round rhexis as far as possible. In this case the posterior hyaloid was attached nasally and so, it wasn´t possible to perform the rhexis 360º

2 – The next step is to create openings in the posterior hyaloid and to try to disconnect the fibrovascular membranes between the arcades.
For delamination, You can either use the 23, 25 or 27 Gauge probe to enter under the hyaloid and slowly remove the bridges between arcades; or even perform bimanual techniques using combinations of forceps, scissors, flute needle or the vitreous cutter. A chandelier light is required for this step.

3 – Another important tip is to Perform a meticulous hemostasis with endodiathermy in peripheral or mid-peripheral active bleeding. You can also use the endolaser for hemostasis of small bleedings.

Try to remove all the vitreous from the periphery under scleral indentation. If necessary you can use Trypan Blue or Brilliant blue dye to remove all macular tractions. Then,  complete PRP, perform FAX and when necessary inject silicone oil, or other tamponade agent in the end of the surgery.

3CcvL7LS8sY,scleral;retinal;,Giant retinal tear - To buckle or not - Author: Flávio Lopes MD,"This is a video shared by Dr Flavio Lopes from Feira de Santana, Brazil

In this video we discuss the role of encircling band with vitreorretinal surgery in cases of GRT.

Some surgeons prefer placing a scleral buckle to support the vitreous base and reduce the risk of recurrent RD in cases of GRT. However, studies show that success rate is no reduce by not placing the buckle in these cases. So, placing an encircling band before vitrectomy surgery in GRT is optional.

Tip#1 - The key point is to use a wide angle system and perform radical base removal.

GRT are usually associated with total PVD and the vitreous removal is a easy step in this surgery. The flap tends to be mobile and care should be taken to prevent accidental and unnecessary bites on the retinal.

Tip#2 - You can keep the flap down with PFCL bubble to perform radical excision of the vitreous base.

The anterior retinal flap to which the vitreous is adherent should be excised as much as possible. If the same is left behind, it can get fibrosed and also exert traction on the ciliary body.

- We recommend place a buckle if you aren´t able to perform lens removal and IOL placement in the same time.
- Another situation that an encircling band may be necessary is in cases of GRT and PVR.

ChZXlGxQbis,scleral;vitrectomy;,Trans-scleral illumination - Author: Filipe Lucatto MD,"This video discuss tips to improve visualization during vitrectomy.

We know that  the use of a Chandelier light in vitrectomy enables a variety of surgical options, allowing better visualization and use of bimanual techniques.

Sometimes, however, the surgeon may have difficulty seeing perfectly the periphery of the retina while trimming the vitreous base. Normally the surgeon becomes safer and more comfortable when he can indenting to himself.

So when the Chandelier light it´s unavailable, or when the light is insufficient for some area, you can perform  a external identation using a 23G traditional handheld endoillumination.

It allows trans-scleral illumination improving the local visualization.

As Limitations to this technique, 25 and 27 Gauge probes are not a good option because they are more flexible. In addition, it is more difficult to perform indentation at 6 and 12 o´clock this way comparing with tradicional scleral depressor.

Tip#1 - to perform anterior vitrectomy to remove all membranes and vitreous from the iris plane so you can bring the lens to the anterior chamber safely.
Tip#2 - It is important to perform posterior hyaloid detachment and to remove all vitreous traction’s around the IOL to avoid peripheral breaks.
The surgeon hold the IOL with a forceps, bring it to the AC. 
Tip#3 You can externelize one of the haptic through a anterior paracentesis. So with the IOL stable in the AC,  use a scissors to cut the IOL body. 
As patient had a intact capsular support a new 3-pieces IOL was implanted in the sulcus.

In this case the surgeon performed a Silicone Oil Retention Suture.

Tip#1 - This technique is indicated when you need implant silicone oil in aphakic eyes, specially when there is iris loss (aniridia, trauma, fixed mydriasis)
Tip#2 - the technique involves placing 10-0 prolene sutures across the anterior chamber to simulate an iris diaphragm. At first a peritomy and scleral sulcus were performed superiorly and inferiorly and then, the prolene needle was inserted 1mm posterior to the limbus from one side of the AC and retrieved across the other side with a 25-gauge needle.
the surgeon then, repeats the same steps in the nasal and temporal regions forming a hashtag suture pattern
Tip#3 - At the end of the sutures the knot is rotated into the scleral sulcus. The sutures acts as a barrier between the SO and the AC preventing SO-corneal contact

Tip#1 - In cases like this a scleral laceration may be located under the rectus muscles. So the area under the muscles can be exposed by gently passing a hook under the muscle and using the it to lift it out of the way.
Tip#2 - first the structural integrity of the globe must be restored providing a water tight closure of the wounds.
Tip#3 - FB may contain copper which cause immediate severe inflamatory changes, or iron, which can cause siderotic damage to the eye. In general, removal on an IOFB is recommended at the same time of a repair of entry site or soon afterwards.

TXqeisq_w-Q,conjunctival;phaco;trabeculectomy;retinal;,Silicone Oil Removal and Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation in Patient with Secondary Glaucoma,"We all know that silicone oil is the agent of choice in complex cases, including retinal detachments with PVR, giant retinal tears, trauma etc. 

In cases where patients are not local. 

And Lately there’s been a lot of discussion about the abuse of silicone oil, we need to know what are the options to treat and resolve these type of complications.

The most frequent complications includes cataract formation, then increased intraocular pressure that is between 2-56%.

Among surgeons who perform many combined phaco and vitrectomy surgeries the number one complication is the increased intraocular pressure. 

In a study that include almost 3,000 patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma, vitreoretinal surgery was found to be the most frequent cause of secondary glaucoma 73% had silicone oil and 60% of them had it for more than 3 months. They found that in the late postop period, glaucoma is most often the result of the emulsification of silicone oil in the anterior cheimber. 


One of the treatments is to remove the silicone oil but In patients with moderate  or high intraocular pressure, uncontrolled high IOP persists even when silicone oil is extracted. Fortunately this can be managed with medication drops but some cases will require other procedures.

Another procedure is trabeculectomy but usually fails due to damaged conjunctiva from previous surgeryes or emulsified silicon oil induces inflammation and fibrosis. And finally when everything goes well, failure still happens in most cases in the first 6 months.


Another option is to place a drainage device most frequent choice is Ahmed Glaucoma Valve this procedure has 62 to 80% success rate combined with silicone oil removal. However you need good candidates for these device specifically healthy conjunctiva and this is reserved for eyes with good visual potential and as you can see on the slide there are complications too.  

Another treatment is transscleral cyclophotocoagulation the goal of this procedure is to reduce the introcular pressure by destroying the ciliary body. The advantages are: this type of surgery doesn’t depend on conjunctival integrity, its not influenced by the presence of silicone oil and retreatment is possible and simple.

The success rate is between 60 to 80% 

The risk of hypotony is similar to other procedures 

Loss of light perception frequently is the result of evolution of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

XZ5bAYo6ISQ,cataract surgery;retinal;,"Cataract Surgery Tijuana, Mexico| Trifocal lens | Presbyopia","Cataract is estimated to affect 52.6 million people worldwide and is globally estimated to cause 33% of total visual impairment and 51% of total blindness. With 83% of total cases of blindness considered to be preventable, cataract is the number one cause not only of blindness but of preventable blindness globally. As major efforts continue to reduce this disease burden, with increasing rates of cataract surgery and improving refractive postoperative outcomes, rates of global blindness due to cataract have been declining. As paradigms in management strategy for patients with cataract shift from a focus on anatomic resolution of disease toward patient-centered care responsive to individual patient wants and needs, refractive considerations are increasingly important in preoperative evaluation and surgical planning. Patients not accustomed to corrective spectacle wear preoperatively tend to have greater expectations of postoperative spectacle independence for both distance and near vision after cataract surgery. Due to the popular desire for spectacle independence postoperatively, use of intraocular lens (IOL) for presbyopia correction in the setting of cataract surgery is an increasingly prevalent aspect of premium cataract surgery practice. IOL technology has advanced significantly over the past several decades, and an increasingly diverse set of options for IOL correction of presbyopia has become available to physicians. An understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each IOL technology is fundamental to proper patient selection, preoperative counseling, and surgical planning. 

The first of its kind, multifocal IOLs for correction of presbyopia were first implanted in human eyes in 1986 but were initially slow to be widely adopted. A large variety of multifocal IOLs have been developed. Although early models such as the BioFilmCon have been discontinued, many multifocal IOLs remain widely available worldwide, though only a select few have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for sale in the United States. Multifocal IOLs may be categorized as refractive and diffractive as well as bifocal and trifocal. Refraction and diffraction refer to the physical mechanism used by the lens to cause bundling of light at distinct points. IOLs may have both refractive and diffractive design components. Bifocal and trifocal describe the number of distinct focal points at which this light is bundled. Simultaneous perception of disparate images from these multiple focal points can be initially disturbing to patients and require a months-long period of neuroadaptation postoperatively. Certain lenses are rotationally asymmetric, with an inferior segment containing the refractive power required for good near vision; positioning of this segment inferiorly, superiorly, temporally, or nasally has not been found to significantly affect visual performance. Extended depth of focus (EDOF) refers to a longitudinally extended continuous focal point and is discussed separately.

DURING YOUR VISIT WITH THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST, IT IS IMPORTANT TO SPEAK ABOUT YOUR NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS SO THAT YOU AND YOUR OPHTHALMOLOGIST CAN DECIDE WHAT IS THE BEST OPTION FOR YOU.

Chandelier illumination may be used for patient with vitreous hemorrhage and poor red reflex, and can be practiced more often in phacoemulsification surgery combined with vitrectomy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we see significant conjunctival chemosis during a resident cataract surgery. Although the main incision is appropriately made, it likely nicked part of the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva gradually becomes progressively more edematous throughout the surgery. In this case, the resident initially ignores the chemosis, then attempts and fails to reduce the chemosis by making a large incision with Westcott scissors.

Tips:
1. As soon as you start noticing conjunctival chemosis, STOP. Make several small radial incisions (4-6) with a sideport or supersharp blade to allow for fluid to drain.
2. Trying to make one large incision and milking fluid out of the subconjunctival space will likely not work as fluid is trapped in the tenons and other tissues.
3. Keep sufficient distance between the chopper and the phaco probe to allow for good chops. Having the two in too close of proximity does not give you enough leverage to make chops.
4. As always, rhexis size is critical. Too small, and it will make the res of the surgery significantly harder. Shoot for at least a 5 to 5.5mm rhexis.",surgery,cataract,ophthalmology

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris prolapse is caused by a pressure differential between the anterior chamber and the outside world. In this case, the pressure differential is caused in part by BSS from hydrodissection getting trapped behind the nucleus. 

Tips: 
1. A smaller rhexis, combined with aggressive hydrodissection, can trap balanced salt solution (BSS) behind the lens. This can push the nucleus forward, increase anterior chamber pressure, and precipitate iris prolapse.
2. Quite simply: iris prolapse is caused by a pressure gradient between the anterior chamber and the outside world. Relieve the pressure gradient, and the iris will return back to its proper place.
3. The chopper should not sit idle. Either use the chopper to help chop or use it to help protect the capsule.
4. Come out quickly with instruments to reduce BSS outflow that re-prolapses the iris.
5. You can turn the infusion sleeve downwards to push iris out of the way while entering the eye.
6. Cohesive viscoelastic is not super helpful for pushing back the iris, as it will prolapse out easily. 
7. Place a corneal suture with the eye at physiologic pressure.

Once reinstated, he went to see several ophthalmologists but according to him, none of them seemed comfortable to help him.

Surgical exploration revealed easy removal of Elschnig pearls/cortex/LECs with the I&A handpiece.  Exploration revealed 360 degrees of zonular support with no evidence of posterior capsular tears despite incomplete anterior capsular tears.  Sulcus IOL placement revealed good support.

Pupillary cerclage with a purse-string suture and a baseball stitch technique using a 10-0 prolene suture on a CIF-4 needle.   Careful tension is needed to ensure proper sizing of the pupil.

Preoperatively, the patient had hand motion vision.  Postoperatively, the patient had 20/30 vision sc, correctable to 20/20.  He had more symmetric pupils postop and was tearfully grateful for a successful surgical outcome.

akN30SBlEGo,cataract surgery;pars plana vitrectomy;,Managing Posterior Capsule Rupture,"This is a case of posterior capsular rupture.  Steps are described to minimize complications and maximize safety.

1. Early recognition.  If you don't recognize it, you can't fix it.  And before you know it, there could be more vitreous in the AC and loss of lens material into the vitreous space.  Certainly, this can still happen with early recognition, but early recognition will limit the problems.

2. Keep the phaco tip in the AC under continuous irrigation.  Allowing the AC to collapse will cause fluid to flow out of the eye and invite vitreous into the anterior chamber and out of the incision.

3. Inject dispersive OVD into the area of the posterior capsule defect then withdraw the phaco tip when the AC looks stable.  Dispersive OVD will tamponade vitreous from coming into the AC.

4. Pause and decide your game plan.  In this case, there was a few lens fragments and all the cortex remained.

5. Under low irrigation setting (lower the bottle height or reduce IOP), place the I&A port right up and against the cortex and slowly increase AFR and vacuum to remove cortical material.  Avoid aspirating aqueous, BSS, OVD.

6. Dry aspiration of the cortex is very controlled and effective.  It minimizes the risk of vitreous coming forward.

7. Use dispersive OVD to push lens fragments to the incision to burp out.

8. Preplace a 10-0 nylon suture for the main temporal incision before the vitrectomy.  Placing the suture after vitrectomy will collapse the AC and can invite more vitreous.

9. Pars plana vitrectomy is superior to anterior vitrectomy because vitreous will flow posteriorly rather than anteriorly.  This allows more efficient vitreous removal and reduces vitreous manipulation.  Pars plana infusion should only be done with training and experience.  Anterior infusion through a paracentesis is adequate and effective as this encourages flow away from the AC.

10. Plan which type of IOL, IOL power target, and location of IOL placement.  Remember single-piece acrylic IOLs should not be placed into the ciliary sulcus.

10. Inject miostat, miochol, or intraocular triamcinolone to ensure there is no vitreous in the AC or to the wound.

11. Tie off incisions with 10-0 nylon suture to reduce the risk for postop vitreous prolapse.

12. Inject subconj antibiotics to reduce risk for endophthalmitis.",cataract surgery,phaco chop,double chop,cross chop,phacoemulsification,complications,posterior capsule rupture,posterior capsule tear,vitreous management,vitrectomy,pars plana vitrectomy,PPV,dry aspiration,ciliary sulcus
XGW0OLmVbbY,scleral;cataract surgery;pars plana vitrectomy;,A Mysterious Case of UGH syndrome.  IOL Exchange and Intrascleral Haptic Fixation (Glued IOL),"This is a 68 yo WM who had cataract surgery outside the country.  Serial examinations revealed variable IOPs which ranged from as low as the teens to as high as in the 30-40s.  There was no significant IOL-donesis, transillumination defects, inflammation, Krukenberg Spindles.  Nonetheless, I suspected an UGH syndrome and determined to take him to the OR but I was not certain what I would find.

It turns out, not only did he have a 3-piece IOL in the bag with an open PC but he also had a 1-piece IOL in the sulcus.  This single piece acrylic IOL in the sulcus was very mobile and most likely the cause for the UGH syndrome.  The capsular bag-IOL complex was very unstable and thus an IOL exchange, PPV, and placement of a glued IOL using intrascleral haptic fixation technique was used.  Postoperatively, the patient's vision improved to baseline, his pressure spikes resolved, and I was able to reduce his glaucoma drops.",IOL exchange,intraocular lens implant exchange,Lewicky anterior chamber maintainer,intrascleral haptic fixation,glued IOL,scleral fixated intraocular lens,scleral fixated IOL,UGH syndrome,pars plana vitrectomy,Brian Kim,Professional Eye Associates,Dalton,Georgia,IOL cutter,IOL removal,katena,agarwal

I have experience with the above techniques but I have never used the Akreos goretex technique.

After having done the Akreos goretex technique, my impression is that this was not too technically challenging or cumbersome to do.  I will, however, need to make some adjustments for my next case to be more efficient.  this technique provides 4 point fixation and uses goretex suture which is extremely strong and stable.

ZmZyNHlDxVs,conjunctival;retinal;,Aphakic DMEK,"Aphakic eyes with a large iris defect (unicameral eyes) are typically operated on using DSAEK and a safety suture technique to guard against posterior dislocation. Here we are sharing our experience of techniques for creating a temporary barrier between the anterior and posterior chambers in unicameral eyes to facilitate DMEK. Unicameral eyes have often had multiple previous surgeries, ongoing problems with inflammation and secondary glaucoma, and are therefore at a relatively high risk for rejection. Advantages for DMEK in this context are relatively low graft rejection rates, and relative protection from postoperative posterior dislocation (most DMEK dislocations are partial). We start by showing the use of an ICL as a temporary barrier. This is relatively high cost, and technically difficult. We believe the safety net suture technique, in which a cats cradle of horizontal and vertical passes (3x5 or 5x5) across the anterior chamber is created with a continuous 10/0 polypropylene suture on a double armed straight needle, is a more accessible and technically easier approach. 

It may be useful where a full anterior segment reconstruction, nicely described by Donald Tan from Singapore in recent presentations, is not indicated; either to minimise risk in a successful contact lens wearer, or as an alternative to a Gundersen flap in eyes with poor visual potential that have had previous retinal or glaucoma drainage surgery (making conjunctival dissection very difficult)."

wnMCU5JigQw,phacoemulsification;retinal;,"Management of White Cataract with Fibrosed Lens Capsule, Large and Nucleus HD (Unedited)","WARNING:  Teaching Surgical procedures video which some viewers may find disturbing and not appropriate. The content is intended for medical professionals, students, and ophthalmic surgeons and not for the general audience.
Per operative complications during phacoemulsification surgery for a white hypermature cataract with a fibrosed capsule can be particularly challenging due to the increased density and hardness of the nucleus, as well as the potential weakness and brittleness of the capsule. Here are some of the complications that may arise:
 Capsule Rupture: The brittle nature of the fibrosed capsule increases the risk of intraoperative capsule rupture, which can lead to vitreous loss and retinal complications.
Zonular Dialysis: The zonules may be weak or damaged, leading to zonular dialysis during phacoemulsification, which can result in lens dislocation.
 Endothelial Damage: The dense nucleus may require more phaco power for emulsification, increasing the risk of corneal endothelial damage.

Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) is often considered safer than phacoemulsification for white hypermature cataracts with fibrosed capsules because it involves creating a larger incision and manually removing the cataract, which reduces the risk of complications associated with high phaco power and manipulation within the eye. SICS is also advantageous in settings with limited resources, as it requires less sophisticated equipment and can be performed more quickly.

In summary, while phacoemulsification is a widely used technique, SICS may offer a safer alternative for managing complex cases of white hypermature cataracts with fibrosed capsules, particularly in resource-limited settings. It's important for the surgical team to assess each case individually and choose the most appropriate technique based on the specific clinical scenario and available resources.

This was a traumatic cataract in a young patient. Manual small incision cataract surgery was planned. Anterior capsulotomy was done. While during nucleus rotation posterior capsule was found suspicious and the nucleus material started sinking. Anterior vitrectomy was done and the nucleus was salvaged from sinking, The remaining cortical matter cleared and anterior was completed, and IOL was implanted in the sulcus.

Introduction
Anterior Vitrectomy With Scleral Fixation IOL  (Unedited) 4K  
This was a referred case.
The first surgeon had planned clear corneal temporal  phacoemulsification but per operatively had posterior capsule rupture and unstable capsular bag .Then the primary surgeon converted to temporal SICS. I got at this stage. The anterior vitrectomy done first from temporal port. Then, the scleral tunnel is made superiorly. Again anterior vitrectomy was done. Two-point fixing ,scleral fixating IOL was done. Patient had corrected 6/12 vision on post operative  day 3.The video is not edited for the benefit of the viewer to understand steps as  it was a real time surgery.

Medial rectus recession is done for convergent strabismus (squint) either with lateral  rectus resection of ipsilateral eye or medial rectus recession of contralateral eye. We are demonstrating medial rectus recession through limbal approch in this video.
Description
Fornix based small conjunctival incision is 10 mm from limbus in infero nasal quadrant is given 
Then incision is given to tenons to expose bare sclera
Small muscle hook is passed under the lateral rectus muscle and whole width of muscle is taken.
Conjunctiva over the muscle is stretched out with lens hook
Small nick is given in the inter muscular ligament at the tip of muscle hook.
Green's muscle hook is passed under the muscle
Intramuscular ligament and check ligaments are cut
Central full thickness interlocking 6-0 vicryl suture place.
Interlocking sutures placed at superior and inferior margins
Muscle is then disinserted carefully
Desired amount of recession is measured

- assess anterior chamber depth and rule out any posterior pushing mechanisms
- check patency of the ostomy or filtering device in the anterior chamber
- assess bleb morphology (most likely flat)
Then while observing the #bleb I perform digital ocular compression, striving for elevation to reestablish flow. This video illustrates: there is a chance that when the IOP is high enough that the scleral tunnel may be under sufficient pressure that the #Preserflo can become occluded. An anterior chamber paracentesis may relieve this pressure and allow flow to be reestablished through the #Preserflo."

yQCRdHuxmmY,conjunctival;scleral;,PreserFlo MicroShunt Implantation,"In this YouTube video, we would like to explain the steps of PreserFlo MicroShunt implantation in ophthalmic surgery. The PreserFlo MicroShunt is a drainage implant used for the treatment of glaucoma. Let's now take a closer look at the individual steps in detail.

The first step involves opening the conjunctiva and creating a conjunctival flap. The conjunctiva is carefully opened, and a flap is created to facilitate access to the surgical area.

Next, the conjunctival flap is prepared. Three sponges soaked in Mitomycin C (MMC) at a concentration of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/ml are used. These sponges are applied for a total of 2 minutes, taking care to avoid the limbus area. MMC is used to reduce scarring and improve the success of the surgery.

After the conjunctival flap is prepared, another sponge soaked in Mitomycin C (MMC) at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml is applied for 2 minutes. The limbus is carefully avoided during this step as well. MMC is again used to minimize the formation of scar tissue.

Next, an incision is made slightly more than 3 mm away from the limbus. This incision serves as the access point to the anterior chamber of the eye.

Once the incision is made, a scleral pocket is created. This pocket provides space for the actual implant, the PreserFlo MicroShunt. The shunt is an 8.5 mm long drainage implant that facilitates the outflow of aqueous humor, thereby lowering intraocular pressure.

Now, the implant is inserted into the prepared scleral pocket. Care is taken to ensure that it is placed securely and stably.

Finally, the patency of the implant is checked. The anterior chamber is flushed with a saline solution to ensure that the aqueous humor can flow freely through the PreserFlo MicroShunt.

Those were the steps of PreserFlo MicroShunt implantation in ophthalmic surgery. We hope that this explanation has helped you better understand the procedure. Please note that this is a general overview, and the exact approach may vary from case to case. If you have further questions or need more information, please consult a qualified ophthalmic surgeon. Thank you for watching!"

It allows the entire surgery to be performed under the microscope unlike conventional surgery which needs visualization with the indirect ophthalmoscope. For endoillumination I use a self retaining 25G Awh endoilluminator connected to a photon light source. This form of endoillumination enables good visualization of the entire retina upto the ora serrata using the VOLK ROLS system (through which this surgery has been performed) or using the BIOM. Localization of visible as well as other breaks can be more accurately and precisely located due to available magnification from the microscope. The breaks are then cryoed under microscope visualization. Following these critical steps, the endoilluminator can be removed and other steps like passing the scleral sutures and buckle placement can be completed. 
The author has so far performed 11 retinal detachment surgeries over the past 4 months using this new technique.

Alze4JNb9w4,scleral;retinal;,Inverted ILM flap technique for large macular holes,"This is a video shared by Dr. Mario Gutierrez from Guatemala City - Guatemala
 
This is a case of a large macular hole in a patient recently treated with scleral buckle for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
For this procedure, it was programmed pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling. The technique chosen by the surgeon was the inverted ILM flap technique.
 
There are some variations on this technique regarding the position of the flap. In the technique first described, the internal limiting membrane was peeled leaving it attached to all the circumference of the macular hole, and at the end of the surgery, the flap was inverted to fill the hole.
 
After finishing the peeling, due to the mobility of the Internal limiting membrane, it is difficult positioning the flap into the macular hole. So, the surgeon injected a perfluorocarbon liquid bubble at the posterior pole to stabilize the flap and help to keep it inside the hole.
In the end of the surgery the vitreous base was review and endolaser was performed in inferior breaks and then fluid air exchange are made.
The inverted ILM flap was kept stable in the correct position even after PFCL removal.

The surgical maneuvers were performed bimanually under twinlight chandelier. A h-AM patch of 1mm in diameter was harvested and brought into the vitreous cavity using ILM forceps through a trocar, which valve had just been removed. The h-AM patch was implanted under the retinal edges of the FTMH with the stromal layer facing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and then fluid/air exchange was performed.

-Represent 1.5% of all rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.
-Incidence in general population estimated to be approximately 1 case per 2 million individuals per year.
-Surgery is technically difficult and should be performed by an experienced surgeon.
-Rate of reattachment following one procedure is 80-90%.

Giant retinal tears (GRTs) are full-thickness circumferential tears of more than 90 degrees of the retina that are associated with vitreous detachment. They are related to OCULAR TRAUMA, high myopia, aphakia, pseudophakia, genetic mutations involving collagen and young age. Giant retinal tears comprise 1.5% of all rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and the average age of incidence is 42 years. Giant retinal tear are more common in males, as 72% of all cases occur in males. The incidence of Giant retinal tear in the general population is estimated to be 0.05 per 100,000 individuals. Common techniques used in the management of giant retinal tears include fluid-air exchange, pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, primary vitrectomy with gas or silicone oil tamponade, and combined scleral buckle-vitrectomies. However, management of giant retinal tears poses a great challenge to physicians due to the high risk of intra- and post-operative complications and the many technical difficulties involved. The advent of perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCL) and the use of micro-incisional surgery for the treatment of giant retinal tear has provided new opportunities for the management of giant retinal tears. Today, retinal reattachment can be achieved in 94-100% of cases.

YaStfTpaNBQ,conjunctival;phacoemulsification;retinal;,Tips on Endophthalmitis,"This is a case shared by Dr. Thiago Siqueira from Niterói Brazil

This is a 45 year old female patient, submitted to phacoemulsification in the left eye. In the second day postoperatively she had worsening in the visual acuity associated with conjunctival hyperemia and hypopyon. For the treatment, on the same day a broad spectrum antibiotic injection was made. Since, the patient didn´t have clinical improvement of the inflammation and vitreits, pars plana vitrectomy and new antibiotic injection was programmed.
In cases of endophthalmitis, it is important to take a sample from the core vitreous before turning the infusion on. So, you can first place the cannulas and position the infusion line, but  keep it off. If you weren't able to see the infusion cannula on the pars plana, consider placing an anterior chamber maintainer. 
Then connect a 3ml syringe to the aspiration path of your vitrector and keep the mouth of the probe in the central vitreous with high cut rates. In the meantime, your assistant gently aspirates manually  the undiluted vitreous sample. 
The material is then immediately sent to the laboratory for Gram and Giemsa stain, as well as cultures on blood agar, chocolate agar, brain-heart infusion, Sabouraud's media and thioglycolate broth.
Here we can see that the surgeon aspirates a small sample of the central vitreous in the puppilary plane, with the pars plana infusion still turned off. Then, he changes the position of the infusion line to the anterior chamber, since it was not possible to check its position in the pars plana.

In these cases, sometimes, the poor visualization will allow only the safety removal of the core vitreous. In the beginning, try to remove the anterior vitreous holding the probe at the pupillary plane avoiding excessive movement As soon as you are able to see better the retinal vessels, try to move posteriorly your probe, and with possible, detach carefully the posterior hyaloid. PVD induction and removal of epiretinal membranes are the most difficult steps in endophthalmitis surgery because sometimes the retina is very fragile and easy to induce retinal breaks. Avoid aggressive removal of all infiltrated vitreous in the basal area. 

If possible, try to remove the remaining inflammatory debris in the anterior chamber and capsular bag. In some cases the IOL and capsular complex removal can be considered. 
In this case, once retinal breaks did not occur, silicone oil was not used as tamponade.
The procedure is completed by closing all incisions in a watertight manner and injecting broad-spectrum intraocular antibiotics.

9yGkoYtb6yA,scleral;retinal;,Giant Retinal Tear - To buckle or not to buckle,"This is a case shared by Dr. Melvin Gutiérrez and Dr. Santiago Morales from Barranquilla Colombia
 
This is a case of Giant Retinal Tear treated with Scleral Buckling and combined  phaco/vitrectomy
 
It was a superior retinal detachment with attached macula in the right eye in a young patient.
 
To place a Scleral Buckle or not in cases of Giant retinal tear is still a controversial topic. Studies have shown similar postoperative complications, functional or anatomical success rates with both approaches. However, some surgeons prefer to add a SB once it can support the vitreous base, reduce the circumference of the globe and relieve the vitreoretinal traction in the periphery. Furthermore, it can provide an easier shaving of the vitreous base especially in phakic eyes. 
It's important to be aware that SB can increase the chance of retinal slippage if it is sutured too tight. It occurs due to a change in ocular contour and scleral shortening relative to retina gaping of retinal tissue. 

Heavy liquids are very useful in these cases once it  keeps the retinal flap down and helps to remove all the subretinal fluid.
 
It’s important to perform radical excision, removing as much as possible the vitreous base and also the anterior flap, under scleral indentation.

Another key point of this surgery is to remove all the fibrosed and folded border of the retinal flap. 

Then, endolaser is made around the tear.

During fluid-air exchange, you can avoid slippage by thoroughly removing the subretinal fluid before PFCL aspiration. Tilt the eye away from the tear while aspirating the subretinal fluid and when the tear is completely dry, you can remove the remaining PFCL.

This is most easily done with the small gauge bimanual vitrectomy instrumentation. With the appropriate settings on your phaco machine, we can make precise, full-thickness iridotomies in a minimally traumatic manner. 

The key is to have appropriate settings for the phaco machine:

mode must be ""I/A Cut"" so that foot pedal position 1 is irrigation, 2 is aspiration, and 3 is activating the cutting action of the vitrector

the infusion pressure (or bottle height) can start at 50 mmHg in order to give a sufficiently deep anterior chamber. You can go higher if needed. 

the vacuum level should be at least 300 mmHg with a quick rise

the cut rate for the vitrector should be very low. You want just 1 or 2 cut actions per second which is a cut rate of 120 cuts/minute or less.

On the phaco machine used in this video the lowest cut rate is 100 cuts/minute, which is good. 

Make two paracentesis incisions in the eye. Simply place the infusion cannula in the eye to inflate the anterior chamber with one hand, while the other hand inserts the vitrector with the port facing down. Place this open port over the peripheral iris and step down to position 2 to aspirate some of the iris into the port. Now step down more to position 3 to activate the cutter for just a bite or two of the iris. This will result in a clean and effective peripheral iridotomy and the size can be expanded as needed by repeating the steps.",cataract surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,peripheral iridotomy,iridectomy,iridotomy,surgical PI

l9lL9izgKtk,scleral;anterior chamber paracentesis;retinal;,Transconjunctival drainage of Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage,"This is a video shared by Dr. Flávio Rezende from Montreal – Canadá 

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a potentially devastating condition and surgical intervention is indicated when severe anterior chamber shallowing occurs, when there is a retinal detachment associated, severe ocular pain or in cases of kissing choroidals.
 
In this video we describe a technique for the drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 23-gauge transconjunctival trocar.
 
In this technique, it is not necessary to perform peritomy and 3mm scleral incisions like in the standard technique. In most cases, it’s not necessarily also performing PPV, and it is reserved only for cases of vitreous hemorrhage, Retinal Detachment and retinal incarceration. 
 
The goal of this procedure is to resolve kissing choroidals and flat AC and to remove blood from the macular region
 
Ultrasonography is used not only to document location and height of the detachment but also to determine proper timing for drainage by monitoring blood liquefaction. Intraoperative OCT was made showing a closed angle and flat anterior chamber before drainage.
 
First, an anterior chamber paracentesis is made to place a 23-gauge infusion line and to restore IOP. Even with the infusion, the OCT shows that the angle maintains closed yet.
The next step is to place a 23-gauge trocar/cannula system into the suprachoroidal space, creating a transconjunctival sclerotomy, 8 mm from the limbus at the most detached quadrant. (determined 1-2 days pre-operatively using B-scan ultrasonography). Ensure the Choroidal detachment is at least 5mm and determine the best drainage location with B-scan US.
 
In this figure we can see the correct technique with a incision toward equator 8mm from the limbus. Pars plana incisions are not recommended. Depending on the angle of entry, pars plana incisions can place the trocar into the vitreous cavity, with consequent not drainage, or even damaging the peripheral and/or posterior retina and choroid.

A Beveled incision is a key point, and it is critical not change the angle of entry. An angle of approximately 45º is best to penetrate the scleral arc without trauma in the choroid or retina.So, it’s necessary to avoid biplanar incisions. 
 
Here, an animation showing how perpendicular incisions can harm inadvertently other structures. However, too flat of an entry may lead to intra-scleral trocar placement instead of suprachoroidal.
There is a second key-point regarding the sclerotomy: You need to make a fast and controlled incision to place the trocar. 
 
The sclera seems to be softer when the choroid is detached, so it tends to move together with your trocar tip while you push the incision place. A controlled and fast incision with the eye well stabilized to avoid globe rotation it’s recommended.
 
It’s preferable to use non-valved cannulas, or alternatively you can maintain it open with forceps during drainage.
 
In this case, the surgeon placed a pars plana 23-gauge trocar and the detachment was monitorized with endoillumination. Intraoperative OCT shows that there´s no residual subretinal blood in macula, and after drainage, we can see in the OCT images that the angle was opened again

Bglnm8ZQfNU,conjunctival;scleral;retinal;,Tips on primary vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,"This is a pseudophakic patient and therefore sclerotomies were performed 3 mm from the limbus. It is important to make a conjunctival displacement with a forceps or with the trocar tip before the incision. The trocar is then positioned in an angled manner and sclerotomy is made in beveled and uniplanar incision. 
For the infusion placement, first, it's necessary to ensure that the infusion line is fluid-filled. Then, interrupt the flow and connect the line on the inferotemporal cannula and ensure that it is properly secured. Verify if the cannula tip is in the correct position in the vitreous cavity with endoillumination light pipe, or with a forceps acting as mirror, and only after checking, turn on the infusion. In this case, the Chandelier light was used to promote better visualization and greater independence for the surgeon. The superior sclerotomies were made in a bimanual technique in which one hand helps to hold the eye while the contralateral incision is made. 
Non contact viewing system allows also more independence for the surgeon, and it is possible to get good visualization from the posterior pole and periphery with the same lens. Before starting the vitrectomy the surgeon moves the BIOM wheel down to set the focus on the optic disc. Then, the microscope body is moved down to enhance the visual field. In the beginning of the PPV, the anterior vitreous behind the IOL and near the trocars are removed. The core vitreous is then aspirated using diffuse illumination and high cut rates. In this step you can aspirate the subretinal fluid with the cutter on through the break to facilitate the PVD maneuver in the next step. If possible, remove the flap from the break. 
PVD induction is an important step in all vitrectomy cases. In this case the patient had already the vitreous detached. Even though the PVD maneuver was made to ensure the detachment. So the vitrectomy probe is placed in the nasal side of the disc and the vacuum is enhanced while the probe is moved to the mid periphery and anteriorly. If necessary, adjuncts like Triamcinolone can be used in this step.
For reattaching the retina, heavy liquids can be an important tool once it allows to stabilize the posterior retina, and condenses the remaining vitreous in the periphery facilitating the vitreous shaving. It is important to inject PFCL in a single bubble to avoid migration to subretinal space. You can avoid injecting under pressure by reducing the IOP, inject PFCL while aspirating with the cutter on the other hand, or by using proper cannulas like Dual bore.
The vitreous base is made under scleral indentation and with high cut rates and low vacuum. It's important to avoid iatrogenic breaks by keeping the vitrectomy cutter above the area of indentation. You can also turn the mouth of the vitrector alway from the periphery to reduce the risk of engaging retinal tissue. The vitreous shaving is more efficient when removal is performed from posterior to anterior. If you were using non-valved cannulas, remember to use plugs during scleral indentation to avoid hypotony and loss of PFCL.After finishing the vitreous base, the eye is filled with PFCL to remove the remnant subretinal fluid and reattach the retina. During injection, it's important to tilt the eye away from the break so the SRF will be slowly pushed through it. This way you can avoid trapped SRF in the periphery that will eventually slip posteriorly during the FAX.
Endolaser was made in the periphery only around the area of the break superiorly, and around the lattice degeneration inferiorly. Endolaser performed 360º in the periphery is still a controversial point, and usually not indicated for all cases. 
Unlike the injection of PFCL, during the FAX the eye must be tilted in the direction of the break. In this way, the surgeon will be able to remove all the fluid around the perfluor area, and from the subretinal space, while the gas enters into the eye through the infusion line. Only after BSS removal, the vitrector is moved into the PFCL bubble. Be careful about the possibility of traumatic neuropathy related to optic disc touch. Use a soft tip cannula to aspirate the residual PFCL avoiding direct aspiration above the optic disc. After FAX, remember to check all the periphery and complete laser if necessary.
Check about air leakage before implanting the tamponade agent. If any evidence of leakage, after removing the cannulas, suture the sclerotomies with Vycril 7.0.
In this case SF6 gas in a non-expanding concentration of 20% was chosen as a tamponade agent. The infusion line are closed, and the syringe with the gas, prepared in the correct concentration is attached in it. Then a 30-gauge needle is placed as a vent to air-gas exchange. In the end, the vent is removed and the eye tonus is checked before removing the last cannula.

TWxp2eWKNHU,phacoemulsification;retinal;,Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: Removal of subretinal membranes,"In this video we discuss a technique for subretinal membranes removal.
This is a surgery of silicone oil removal indicated six months after combined phacoemulsification and vitrectomy to treat RRD.  
In the beginning of the surgery, due to poor mydriasis and posterior capsule opacities, it was difficult to check the correct position of the cannula before opening the infusion line. You can use the back of a forceps as a mirror to help in this step. If the correct position of the infusion line is still uncertain, keep the infusion closed and try to check at the beginning of the vitrectomy.
In this case a 23-gauge Oil Extraction MedOne cannula was used for silicone oil removal. A standard four-port trocar system with Chandelier light was programmed once the patient had subretinal proliferations to be removed in the procedure.
Under BIOM visualization it was possible finally to check the infusion cannula position and turn it on. Then, a surgical capsulotomy was made, to allow better fundus visualization during the silicone oil extraction.
The Oil Extraction cannula has a silicone tube specially shaped to be attached and the silicone oil can be removed either with a standard syringe or with a pump system. During extraction, it’s important to keep the tip of the aspiration cannula inside the silicone bubble, and not in the BSS phase, so you can avoid globe collapse.
The silicone oil removal procedure is an ideal opportunity to deal with situations that can lead to recurrent RD or other problems. 
In this case, the patient had subretinal membranes lifting the retina in the inferior midperiphery. Tripan blue dye was used to check for PVR and ERM to be also removed.
For the subretinal band removal, first Diathermy is made in the middle of the membrane area. Then, the subretinal membrane is grasped with a retinal forceps through a small retinotomy and it is gently moved side to side until the membrane breaks. You can do yet, bimanual technique using forceps and the vitrector to remove all the membrane with minimal peripheral traction.
Even with previous diathermy, a subretinal hemorrhage threatens to go under the macula. So, a small bubble of perfluor was injected until the level of the retinotomy to avoid submacular blood and to perform endolaser. Fluid air exchange was made slowly with a flute needle in passive aspiration to drain all the subretinal fluid and in the end of the surgery, C3F8 14% gas was injected.
 
Neste vídeo, discutimos uma técnica para remoção de membranas subretinianas. Esta é uma cirurgia de retirada do óleo de silicone indicada 6 meses após FACO+VVPP para tratamento de Descolamento de Retina Regmatogênico. No início, devido à pouca dilatação, e opacidades da cápsula posterior, foi difícil verificar o correto posicionamento da cânula antes de abrir a infusão. Você pode usar a parte de trás de uma pinça como espelho nesta etapa. Se a posição correta da infusão ainda for incerta, mantenha fechada e tente reavaliar o início da VVPP. Neste caso, uma cânula de extração de óleo 23-G foi usada para a remoção do OS. Um sistema de trocater padrão em quatro portas com uso da Chandelier foi programado, uma vez que o paciente apresentava proliferações subretinianas para serem removidas. Com o BIOM foi possível finalmente verificar a posição correta da infusão e ligá-la. A seguir, foi realizada capsulotomia, para permitir melhor visualização do fundo durante a extração do OS. A cânula de extração de óleo tem um tubo de silicone com formato especial para ser conectado, e o OS pode ser removido com uma seringa padrão ou com um sistema de bomba. Durante a extração, é importante manter a ponta da cânula de aspiração dentro da bolha do OS, e não dentro do BSS, para que você possa evitar o colapso do globo. O procedimento de remoção do OS é uma oportunidade ideal para lidar com situações que podem levar a DR recorrente ou outros problemas. Nesse caso, o paciente apresentava membranas subretinianas elevando a retina na média periferia inferior. Azul Tripan foi usado para verificar se havia PVR e membranas epi a serem removidos. Para a remoção da banda subretiniana, primeiro é feita a diatermia no meio da área da membrana. Em seguida, a membrana subretiniana é apreendida com uma pinça retiniana por meio de uma pequena retinotomia e é movida suavemente de um lado para o outro até que a membrana se rompa. Você pode fazer ainda, técnica bimanual usando pinça e o vitrector para remover toda a membrana com tração periférica mínima. Mesmo com diatermia feita anteriormente, uma hemorragia subretiniana ameaçava passar por baixo da mácula. Assim, uma pequena bolha de perfluor foi injetada até o nível da retinotomia para evitar sangue submacular e realizar endolaser. A troca fluido-ar foi feita lentamente com a softip em aspiração passiva para drenar todo o líquido subretiniano, e ao final da cirurgia foi injetado gás C3F8 a 14%.

JBIo3Lu7wOE,scleral;retinal;,Pneumatic Retinopexy and the Steamroller technique,"This is a case of a recent RRD in a pseudophakic patient. Patient had only one horseshoe-shaped tear at 2 o’clock, macula wasn’t affected yet, but the operating room wasn’t available for vitrectomy in this day. So the surgeon decided perform pneumatic retinopexy and between all options of gases for this procedure, was used 0.5ml of pure SF6. Before the gas injection a paracentesis was performed. Once the retinal break was temporal, the injection was programmed nasally 0.3mm from the limbus.

PR can be done in one session, with cryopexy applied to the retinal breaks just before gas injection, or as a two-session procedure, with initial gas injection followed by laser photocoagulation 1 or 2 days later.

For the injection, the 30-gauge needle is directed toward the center of the vitreous and inserted to depth of 7 or 8 mm. Then it is partially withdrawn leaving only 3mm inside the globe. With the needle position uppermost and vertically, the gas is injected evenly and moderately briskly to create one single bubble. Following these steps, you can avoid multiple small bubbles often referred as “fish eggs.

Steamroller Technique can avoid macular detachment after gas injection when the fluid extends and threat the posterior pole. After the injection, the gas bubble tends to push the subretinal fluid to the macular region. Iatrogenic macular detachment is prevented by placing the patient in the face-down position immediately following gas injection. It allows subretinal fluid to pass through the break into the vitreous.
Over 10 minutes, the patient’s head position is very gradually moved along the meridian between the macula and the retinal break until the retinal break is uppermost. In this case retina tear was treated by laser photocoagulation in the next day.

Pneumatic Retinopexy is a good option to treat selected RD cases and it is a less invasive and less expensive procedure comparing with scleral Buckling and vitrectomy

Retinopexia Pneumática e a manobra de Steamroller

Neste vídeo mostramos um caso de descolamento de retina regmatogênico em um paciente pseudofácico. Paciente tinha rotura única em ferradura as 2 horas, com mácula ainda colada. No dia da consulta, por ser véspera de Natal, o centro cirúrgico estava indisponível para realização de vitrectomia via pars plana. Pensando em evitar evolução do quadro e envolvimento macular, o cirurgião indicou Retinopexia Pneumática, que foi realizada no mesmo dia.

O vídeo mostra uma tabela sobre os gases, doses e as expansões esperadas para uso na Retinopexia pneumática:

Intravitreal gas Duration and Expansion:
Gas dose Duration  Largest Size Expansion
Air 0.8ml 4 days  Immediate No expansion 
SF6 0.5ml 12 days         36 hours Doubles 
C3F8 0.3ML 38 days 3 days  Quadruples

Nesta caso, foi usado o SF6 a 100% (0.5ml) e antes da injeção foi realizada uma paracentese de câmara anterior. 
A RP pode ser feita em uma sessão, com aplicação de criopexia na rotura logo antes da aplicação do gás, ou em 2 sessões, com realização de fotocoagulação a laser 1 ou 2 dias após.

Para a injeção do gás, uma agulha de 30-Guage é inserida, na direção do centro da cavidade vítrea em uma profundidade de 7-8mm. Então ela deve ser removida parcialmente até que fique somente com 3mm dentro do olho e posicionada na parte mais superior. O gás então deve ser injetado de maneira continua e com pressão moderada e regular (evitando fazer com muita força). Seguindo está técnica você pode evitar a formação de várias bolhas (conhecida como “fish eggs”)

A técnica de Steamroller é usada para evitar que o DR progrida para a região macular após a injeção do gás.  Após a injeção, a bolha de gás tende a empurrar o fluido para a região do pólo posterior. O descolamento iatrogênico da macula pode ser evitado colocando o paciente em face-down logo após a injeção. Desta maneira, o gás protege a macula e fica no polo posterior e empurra o fluido do DR para a cavidade vítrea através da rotura. Ao longo de cerca de 10 minutos, a cabeça do paciente é gradualmente posicionada ao longo do meridiano entre a mácula e a rotura de maneira que no final, está fique na posição mais superior. 

A retinopexia pneumática é uma técnica menos cara e invasiva para o tratamento de casos selecionados de descolamento de retina

trAyFLaMf5U,scleral;retinal;,Tips on: Shaving peripheral vitreous,"In this video we discuss a tip to improve visualization for shaving peripheral vitreous with scleral depression.

New technologies like wide-angle viewing systems, high-speed vitreous cutters, small-incision trocar systems and chandelier lighting, enable surgeons to perform a thorough vitrectomy, which is crucial for the treatment of many vitreoretinal pathologies. 

Sometimes, however, the surgeon can find difficulties to adequately visualize the peripheral vitreous, even with the use of these technologies. 

In this case, a patient with Proliferative diabetic retinopathy associated with macular traction was submitted to pars plana vitrectomy. After removing all the membranes from the vascular arcades and from the optic disc, a permanent haze associated with bleeding coming from the neovascularization of the optic disc worsened the surgeon's visualization. Endocautery was used in the retinal bleeding points, and the intraocular pressure was temporally increased, but the bleeding in the papila remained.

Even with the use of a Chandelier Light the surgeon didn't have adequate peripheral visualization to shave the vitreous base. 

To improve the contrast and enable better visualization of the peripheral vitreous, you can use trans-scleral illumination at the point of indentation. 
Some surgeons use the endoilluminator probe itself to gently depress the sclera. However, the blunt tip of the scleral depressor allows a more effective and controlled indentation. So, you can hold both instruments, the scleral depressor and the endoillumination probe together to perform trans-scleral illumination and allow a safetier peripheral shaving of the vitreous base.
This technique, however, does not allow the surgeon to slide the scleral depressor how we used to do when using only this instrument. To change the position, you need first to move the scleral depressor and then positioning the endoilluminator probe in the same place. 
It is a simple tip that you can use in several vitrectomy procedures when you are not comfortable with the illumination of the vitreous base.

FbE8RUUJIsk,conjunctival;anterior chamber paracentesis;retinal;,Suprachoroidal Buckle for Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment,"This is a video shared by Dr. Audrey Juan from Santo Domingo Dominican Republic

This is a case of a 35 years old Female with progressive decreased VA in OD in the last 2 months.
As ocular conditions, patient had a previous history of RRD in the left eye treated with Cryopexy and Scleral Buckle 12 years ago.

Her BCVA was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye.

In the Fundoscopy she had a macula Off Temporal retinal Detachment, with a single small hole superotemporally in the periphery.

Surgeon has decided to perform Suprachoroidal Buckle and Cryopexy for the treatment of this case. In this technique a cannula is guided in the suprachoroidal space to reach the target area and then a suprachoroidal filler is injected to create a temporary buckling to close retinal tears and supporting the overlying retina. 

A conjunctival peritomy was performed temporally in the side of the hole followed by cauterization of the sclera. Then she placed a Chandelier light so the Cryo could be done under BIOM visualization.  

An anterior chamber paracentesis was done to avoid increase of IOP during the suprachoroidal injection. Then a 3 mm incision was made 4 mm to the limbus, using a crescent blade to introduce the 23- Gauge Olive tip cannula. 

Olive Tip cannula is a curved cannula designed for suprachoroidal surgery. Note that the large and rounded tip allows gentle placement of filler material in the suprachoroidal space creating a buckle effect.

So, again under BIOM visualization, you can inject long-lasting Hyaluronic acid (Restylane) - that lasts about 2-3 months; or Viscoelastic (Healon GV or Healon 5) - that lasts 3-4 weeks. You can inject until to get the desired indentation. In the end of the surgery the sclera and conjunctiva are sutured.

This patient had a good outcome and three weeks after surgery, it was improvement in the VA and the indentation was still visible. The lesion was sealed, but there was yet a residual subretinal fluid in the posterior pole. Three months after the surgery retina was totally attached with adequate chorioretinal scaring.

As advantages, we can avoid potential problems of episcleral buckling, reducing refractive changings and postoperative discomfort with this technique.

7_iKoXDDGmw,eyelid;scleral;vitrectomy;muscle;,Macular Buckling to treat Myopic Traction Maculopathy,"This is a video shared by Dr. Barbara Parolini from Brescia - Italy
 
In this video we discuss the use of macular buckling to treat myopic traction maculopathy and how to create one. We know that High Myopia and posterior staphiloma may have associated, complications like Myopic foveoschisis with or without Foveal detachment and Macular hole Retinal detachment.
 
Pathogenesis involves progression of the posterior staphyloma, anterior traction, intrinsic rigidity of the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Dr. Parolini is publishing on EJO a new Staging System, that identifies in one table of the stages of MTM, describing the evolution and the prognosis of the disease.
 
Macular Buckling a is a device designed to shorten the axial length of the eye at the posterior pole and have been successful in treating Myopic traction maculopathy associated or not with vitrectomy.  
 
Posterior Buckles of different shapes and materials have been proposed but there are only few commercially available. As they are not easily accessible in all countries Dr. Parolini describes how to make a Home-made model.
 
She proposes a L-Shaped macular Buckle made with a titanium stent, a 507 sponge and a Silicone sleeve. The titanium stent will be bent 90º in its final third. The sponge is cut about 1 cm in length and is placed on this extremity. Then, a 2 cm long silicone sleeve is used to cover the remaining area of the stent and so the total length of the buckle is 3 cm.

In this case a macular buckling is performed without vitrectomy. The first step of this procedure is performing a peritomy and tractions sutures in the superior and lateral rectus muscles. It’s important also, lowering the IOP by performing a paracentesis.
A twin lights fiber optics is used, one to be placed in pars plana and the other one inserted into the sponge inside the buckle. The device is inserted in the supero-temporal quadrant, either parallel to the lateral or to the superior rectus muscle so you are able to reach macula in any type of staphyloma. Then, you can check the correct position of the Buckle intraoperatively by using a panoramic viewing system.
When you reach the correct position, you mark the scleral positions to suture the buckle close to the insertion of the muscle (be careful about the thin sclera and risk of perforation in this location). It’s recommended at least two cross-mattress sutures to avoid tilt of the device.

You can see that the patient can improve not only the BCVA and the anatomical findings on the OCT, but also the microperimetry.
 
The ideal final shape of the posterior surface should be straight horizontal and not convex, at least in some scans (as shown in the pic below)
 
Here we can see that macular buckle doesn’t affect too much the esthetic of the eye and orbit and it only can be visualized by lifting the eyelid and moving the eye.

DBSQGYIZiVo,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Scleral fixation using Slip-knot sutures - Author: Filipe Lucatto MD,"Video presented in the Video Competition session in EURETINA 2019 (Paris).

In this video we describes a technique of scleral fixation using Slip-Knot sutures.

This patient had a poor outcome after cataract surgery and a single-piece PMMA IOL was dislocated to the vitreous cavity. Inicially it was programed a vitrectomy to exchange the IOL, removing it through a scleral tunnel and performing a scleral fixation of a new IOL. 

It was used a CV-8 Gore-Tex suture inserting it through a corneal incision and grasping it through a 23 Gauge sclerotomy 3mm inferotemporal to the limbus. Another sclerotomy was performed also 3mm to the limbus and 3mm apart to the first one. So the another tip of the Gore-Tex was grasped through it forming temporal loop. Then, the surgeon performs a kind of a sliding knot that allows one of the haptic of the IOL to be tied in the vitreous cavity. First it was performed the Slip-knot suture, and then the node was inserted into the eye through the anterior chamber. After being positioned in the middle of the haptic, the surgeon slides the knot and locks it using two retinal forceps. The same surgical steps are repeated on the nasal side to perform the scleral fixation of the other IOL haptic. After tying both haptics we can pull the Gore-Tex sutures bilaterally to perform IOL centralization. 

This is an interesting technique to fix an IOL without having to remove it from the inside of the eye, avoiding additional trauma to a patient who has had poor outcome from cataract surgery. 

This technique can be used for any IOL known to be securely placed in the ciliary sulcus and can minimize the surgical trauma to the iris, corneal endothelium, and to reduce the risks of intraoperative hypotony during scleral fixation surgeries.

Vídeo apresentado no EURETINA 2019 (Video Competition - Paris).

Neste vídeo, descrevemos uma técnica de fixação escleral usando suturas em Slip-Knot.

Este paciente teve complicações durante a cirurgia de catarata e uma LIO PMMA de peça única deslocou-se para a cavidade vítrea. Inicialmente, foi programada uma vitrectomia para troca da lente intraocular (LIO), removendo a lente luxada por um túnel escleral e realizando a fixação escleral de uma nova LIO. Durante a cirurgia porém, a programação foi trocada e decidimos realizar fixação da lente que estava na cavidade vítrea

Foi utilizada suturas de Gore-Tex CV-8, inserindo o mesmo através de uma abertura na córnea e puxando por uma esclerotomia 23 Gauge a 3 mm inferotemporal ao limbo. Outra esclerotomia foi realizada também a 3 mm do limbo e a 3 mm de distância da primeira. Assim, a outra ponta do Gore-Tex foi puxada através dela, formando uma alça temporal. Em seguida, o cirurgião realiza uma espécie de nó deslizante que permite que um dos hápticos da LIO seja amarrado na própria cavidade vítrea com a ajuda de duas pinças de retina. Primeiramente, foi realizado o Slip-knot, e em seguida, o nó foi inserido no olho através da câmara anterior e jogado para a cavidade vítrea. Após ser posicionado no meio do háptico, o cirurgião desliza o nó e o fixa usando dois fórceps  de retina. As mesmas etapas cirúrgicas são repetidas no lado nasal para realizar a fixação escleral do outro háptico da LIO. Depois de amarrar os dois hápticos, podemos puxar as suturas de Gore-Tex bilateralmente para realizar a centralização e posicionamento da LIO.

Essa é uma técnica interessante para fixação escleral da lente intra ocular sem a necessidade de removê-la do interior do olho. Com isso evitamos traumas adicionais para um paciente que teve um desfecho ruim após cirurgia de catarata (danos no endotélio e outras estruturas da câmara anterior).

Essa técnica pode ser usada para qualquer LIO que possa ser colocada com segurança no sulco ciliar, e pode minimizar o trauma cirúrgico da íris, endotélio da córnea e reduzir os riscos de hipotonia intraoperatória durante cirurgias de fixação escleral.

In this case, the patient had prior cataract surgery and the single-piece acrylic IOL has slipped through a damaged capsule and is now in the anterior vitreous. A limbal approach would prove to be difficult and may even result in the IOL being displaced deeper into the vitreous cavity. 

In this case we also do the twist technique to explant the single-piece acrylic IOL via an incision of about 3 mm without using special instruments. And if you look carefully, you will notice that we also use the vitrector to perform a small peripheral iridotomy in this case.

The pars plana approach does require more planning and extra steps such creating and closing a scerlotomy and then carefully checking for entry site breaks. Certainly, any time that we perform a vitrectomy whether anterior or posterior, there is a higher risk for retinal complications such as vitreous traction, retinal breaks/detachment, macular edema, and even endophthalmitis. These patients must be watched carefully in the post-op period and if you are uncomfortable with this higher level of care, it often is best to refer the patient to a vitreo-retinal colleague so that you can do a team approach.",cataract surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,pars plana vitrectomy,anterior vitrectomy,dislocated IOL

He had a one piece PMMA lens inserted after cataract surgery many years ago. PMMA is a solid plastic and cannot be cut in half. It had fallen into the gel. The plan was to remove it as one piece and replace it with a modern 3 piece lens. To get the lens out I needed to create a large wound in the white of the eye that would self seal so I had a firm eye to work with in order to put in the new lens adn fixate it. The tunnel is formed at the top and then vitrectomy ports are placed as the chances of the lens falling to the back of the eye were very high and I needed access before the large wound was formed. Once the ports were in place the wound was formed and the lens was brought into view, grasped and then removed through the wound. A a new lens was inserted through the wound and fixed into the sclera with the needle haptic fixation technique modified from Yamane.

I perform Small incision cataract surgery with trabeculectomy in patients with open angle glaucoma and significant cataract. These patients are usually on maximum medical therapy for glaucoma and want their treatment in free eye camps. Another indication is hard cataract with small pupil Majority of my patients who undergo SICS with Trabeculectomy are from remote places and from economically weaker section. 
I prefer to do clear corneal phacoemulsification followed by trabeculectomy after 3 weeks in my routine cases.
I present a video of small incision cataract surgery with trabeculectomy.
The steps of surgery are given below.
1. Superior rectus bridle suture.
2. A side port is created for removing sub-incisional cortex.
3. Fornix based conjunctival flap.
4. Corneo-scleral tunnel is made using crescent knife.
5. Anterior chamber is entered with a 3mm keratome.
6. The incision is extended with crescent knife/keratome.
7. CCC is performed using Utrata's forceps.
8. Hydro-disection is done and nucleus prolapsed into AC.
9. In this video the nucleus is delivered using visco expression technique.
10. Cortical cleanup is done with Simcoe cannula.
11. PMMA IOL is implanted.
12. AC is formed with viscoelastic material and Trabeculectomy is done using Kelley's punch. Sometimes when I feel the apposition of tunnel is not adequate I put a single 10'O suture to secure the wound.
13. Conjunctival flap is sutured with 8'O silk and these sutures are removed after 3 to 4 weeks.
14. Viscoelastic is removed with Simcoe cannula.
15. Surgery is concluded with sub-conjunctival steroid and antibiotic injection.",SICS with Trabeculectomy,CMC Ludhiana,SICS with Trab.
gybdfVhioDc,conjunctival;cataract surgery;,Conjunctival flap protected limbo corneal incision in SICS using 3mm keratome (I),"SICS is a commonly used technique for doing cataract surgery along with IOL implantation especially in eye camps. 
In a classical SICS we make a conjunctival flap, do heat or bipolar cautery to control bleeding, make a tunnel incision using a knife, crescent knife and keratome to make the self-sealing valvular incision. Cauterization destroys lymphatics/aqueous channels and may worsen the existing glaucoma or change a borderline glaucoma to a moderate glaucoma.
Using the technique shown in the video one can avoid construction of a conventional conjunctival flap but still have the advantage of a conjunctival flap and its advantages i.e. the safety of covering the wound which gives an additional protection to prevent post op infection without compromising the aqueous channels. The keratome is put about 5mm away from limbus and conjunctiva is dragged towards limbus and then the tip of the keratome is used to initiate and complete the incision as routinely done. This way a conjunctival flap is created which covers the incision.
The rest of the surgical steps are the same.
Of course classical SICS is the best surgery if one is not contemplating phacoemulsification. This variant may be tried if surgeon is comfortable with a little messy surgery due to bleeding.

bz_vqApoIUY,scleral;cataract extraction;vitrectomy;,How to Convert from Phaco to Manual ECCE Cataract Surgery,"While it is rare, there are times when it is important to convert from a phaco approach to a manual extra-capsular cataract extraction (ECCE). This is one of those times: we have a dense cataract in the setting of a wide open capsular bag. Removing the nucleus via manual extraction will likely pose less risk of retained lens fragments and will give the patient a better outcome. 

This is a skillset that every ophthalmologist must learn. The key point is to abandon the original corneal phaco incision. The corneal phaco incision is typically less than 3 mm wide and we need an incision which is at least double or even triple that width, depending on the size of the remaining nuclear pieces. While you could enlarge the temporal corneal phaco incision to 3.5 mm or maybe even 4 mm, it is not advisable to go larger than this due to issues with sealing, astigmatism, and healing. 

When we note that the capsule is wide open and that most of the cataract is still inside the eye, care is taken to use viscoelastic to bring the nucleus up into the anterior chamber and then support it with even more dispersive OVD. Now we can create a superior scleral tunnel incision of about 7 mm wide externally and we shape it like a funnel so that the internal opening is larger.

A lens loop is used to bring the remaining large nuclear pieces out of the eye and then a wave of dispersive viscoelastic is used to express the smaller pieces as well. A thorough anterior vitrectomy is performed using 23 gauge instrumentation via two smaller incisions. Avoid using the larger incisions for the vitrectomy since they will tend to leak excessively. 

Once the vitreous has been cleared from the anterior segment, an ACIOL is placed securely. Since there was some temporal iatrogenic damage to the iris, there was no need to perform a surgical peripheral iridotomy.",Catarat surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,ECCE,manual SICS,SICS cataract,ACIOL,convert to ECCE

zuYaWLFyH8U,scleral;cataract surgery;,MSICS: manual small incision cataract surgery,"In many countries where dense, brunescent cataracts are common, the SICS (small incision cataract surgery) or MSICS (manual small incision cataract surgery) techniques are very popular. These are upgraded and evolved versions of the traditional manual extra-capsular cataract extraction (ECCE) technique with many important upgrades. 

The main upgrade is an incision that is carefully shelved so that there is a sufficient tunnel length to provide good closure with few, if any, sutures. The incision is also trapezoidal or funnel shaped with the internal opening larger than the scleral opening. This technique is excellent for truly dense, brunescent cataracts because no ultrasound energy is used to remove the cataract and this can be gentler to the corneal endothelium. Keep in mind that if you are concerned with the refractive outcome of the case, the larger incision used in MSICS will induce far more astigmatism than the typical 2.2 to 2.8 mm phaco incision.  

In the USA, particularly at our resident training programs, we frequently teach this MSICS technique. This is certainly the case at our program at the Jules Stein Eye Institute and Olive View UCLA Medical Center, both part of the UCLA School of Medicine in Los Angeles. This is also taught at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami in Florida and this video is from a resident training at that program.",cataract,cataract surgery,cataract coach,uday devgan md,cataract los angeles,cataract surgery los angeles,SICS,MSICS,ECCE

duMZyJlqCWc,scleral;cataract surgery;retinal;,Intraocular lens scleral fixation: Pearls on Yamane Technique,"This is a video shared by Dr. Ricardo Chagas from Salvador Brazil.

One popular approach to place intraocular lens in the absence of adequate capsular support is the Yamane Technique. This technique involves externalizing the haptics of the IOL using a double needle technique, and then a cautery is used to form a button-like tip at the end of each haptic. 
The advantages of this technique are that we do not need to use sutures or glue, we do fewer incisions, and the surgery use to be quicker and less invasive comparing to the other scleral and iris fixation techniques. However, it´s not an easy surgery for beginners and there is some key points to be listed to avoid complications like tilt or decentration on the IOL, damage in the haptic and scleral haptic extrusion.
 
In this video we discuss some pearls and key steps to improve the results and avoid complications in this technique.
 
1 – The first tip is to use the toric marker to set the positions where the haptics will be grasped through the sclera. This way you can achieve proper centration and better effective lens position. Make also two marks in conjunctiva in each side, 2mm from the limbus and 2mm apart. 

2 – The second tip is related to the IOL choice 
You can use either a three-pieces IOL, Zeiss CT Lucia 602 or Sensar AR40. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) haptics (CT Lucia 602) are more malleable and resistant than Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) haptics (Sensar AR60) so you can prevent erosion through the conjunctiva using the correct IOL.
 
3 – Using the right needle for the procedure is also a key step 
Due to the diameter of the haptics, the inner lumen of the needle must be large enough. The 30-Gauge thin-walled TSK needle is described in the Yamane Technique, but this needle is not commercially available in many countries. As an alternative you can use 27-Gauge although it would require the use of larger scleral tunnel wound. Don’t use standard-bore 30-Gauge needle available in the most surgical centers. This is not an option for this technique.
 
In this video the surgeon injected the IOL in the anterior chamber and then he used a 27-Gauge needle and retinal forceps to dock the haptics bilaterally. Then, after externalizing the haptics he performed the flange using a cautery.

BXDekr8RE_0,scleral;retinal;,Yamane technique with fewer incisions (Pearls on IOL scleral fixation),"This is a video shared by Dr. Hiroto Ishikawa from Nishinomiya Japan

The flanged IOL scleral fixation with double-needle technique was described in 2019 and uses a 31-gauge needle and needle stabilizer. However, in the original Yamane technique, the number of surgical wounds required are six (one for IOL insertion, three for vitrectomy trocars and two for removing the haptics.

In this video the surgeon describes a modified Yamane technique, in which the same 27-gauge trocars of PPV are used to externalize the haptics and perform the flanges, decreasing the number of surgical wounds.
After marking the positions of the haptics at 2 and 8 o’clock, 27-gauge trocars are inserted 2mm from the limbus. Anterior chamber incisions are made, and the infusion is placed in the inferotemporal trocar for the vitrectomy and dislocated IOL extraction.
To manage insufficient mydriasis a pupillary sphincterotomy was made using retinal scissors.
The dislocated IOL and the capsular complex are first cut and then removed through the corneal incision. Then, the vitreous was removed from the anterior chamber with the vitrector and a complete PPV with noncontact wide-field vision system was made. 
After vitrectomy, the infusion line is changed to the superotemporal trocar.
A 3-pieces IOL with PDVF haptics (NX 70s, Santen, Japan) is implanted into the anterior chamber with the injector. Then, a 27-gauge needle is inserted into the nasal trocar at 2 o’clock and a forceps is used to help trailing the haptic into the needle.
The nasal needle is not removed at this moment. Likewise, the second haptic is inserted through a 27-gauge needle at 8 o’clock.
For the externalization of the haptics, the double-needle should not be removed alone. Instead, the trocar and the needle should be removed gently together leaving just the haptic outside. Once the scleral tunnel size formed by the 27-gauge trocar is larger than that formed by a 27-gauge needle (used in the original Yamane technique), 1.5mm length of the haptic is marked for cauterization to create a bigger flange.
This is a useful technique for retinal surgeons in which is possible to reduce the number of required wounds to flanged IOL scleral fixation with double-needle.

Este é um vídeo compartilhado pelo Dr. Hiroto Ishikawa de Nishinomiya - Japão
A fixação escleral usando de uma lente intraocular com duas agulhas e com flanges foi descrita em 2019. Ela usa agulhas de calibre 31 gauge e um instrumento estabilizador para a confecção do túnel com a agulha. Na técnica original de Yamane, o número de incisões cirúrgicas necessárias é seis (uma para a inserção da LIO, três para trocateres da vitrectomia e duas para a externalização dos hápticos.
Neste vídeo, o cirurgião descreve uma técnica de Yamane modificada, em que os mesmos trocartes de 27-gauge da vitrectomia via pars plana são usados para externalizar as alças e realizar os flanges, diminuindo o número de incisões cirúrgicas.
Depois de marcar as posições dos hápticos nas 2 e 8 horas, trocartes de 27-gauge são inseridos a 2 mm do limbo. As incisões da câmara anterior são feitas, e a infusão é colocada no trocater temporal inferior para a vitrectomia e extração da LIO deslocada.
Para melhorar a midríase, uma esfincterotomia pupilar foi feita com uma tesoura.
A LIO deslocada e o complexo capsular são cortados e depois removidos através da incisão corneana. Em seguida, o vítreo é removido da câmara anterior com o vitrector e a VVPP com sistema de visão de campo amplo sem contato foi realizada.
Após a vitrectomia, a linha de infusão é trocada para o trocater temporal superior
Uma LIO de 3 peças com hápticos de PDVF (NX 70s – Santen, Japan) é implantada na câmara anterior com o injetor. Em seguida, uma agulha de 27-gauge é inserida no trocater nasal às 2 horas e uma pinça é utilizada para ajudar a passar o háptico dentro do lumen,
A agulha nasal não deve ser removida neste momento. Da mesma forma, o segundo háptico é inserido através de uma agulha 27-gauge às 8 horas.
Para a externalização das alças, a agulha não deve ser removida sozinha. Ao invés disso, o trocater e a agulha devem ser removidos suavemente em conjunto, deixando apenas o haptico da LIO para fora. Uma vez que o tamanho do túnel escleral formado pelo trocater de 27-gauge é maior do que o formado por uma agulha de 27-gauge (usada na técnica de Yamane original), 1,5 mm de comprimento da alça é marcada para cauterização e para criar um flange maior.
Essa é uma técnica útil para cirurgiões de retina, na qual é possível reduzir o número de incisões necessárias para a fixação escleral da LIO com a técnica de Yamane.

This is a patient with a poor outcome after cataract surgery in which a 3 pieces IOL, inserted in the ciliary sulcus has dislocated with the capsular complex to the vitreous cavity postoperatively.
 A new procedure was programmed, to perform intrascleral IOL fixation of the same dislocated lens using a technique called Inverted L IOL fixation.
In this technique described by Dr. Santiago Morales, two local conjunctival peritomy are made nasally and temporally. Then the surgeon marks two points 180º apart and a ""L shaped"" scleral sulcus is made on each side.
So the surgeon performs a scleral flap first temporally.
The nasal flap is made in the same way, but, note that the ""L shaped"" incision is made in the opposite direction from the other one.
Then a paracentesis is made, viscoelastic is injected, and the IOL is positioned in the anterior chamber above the iris.
The capsular complex with Soemmering's ring is then removed with the vitrector and complete pars plana vitrectomy is made.
After finishing PPV, two 20G sclerotomy is made bilaterally 2 mm from the limbus into the flaps. The nasal IOL haptic is grasped through the sclerotomy using two retinal forceps in handshake technique. The second IOL haptic is then externalized with a retinal forceps while the surgeon holds the first one. Then a scleral tunnel incision is made with a 27G needle to place the haptics intrascleral bilaterally.
In the end of the procedure, scleral flaps and conjunctiva are closed using Vrycril sutures.

Este é um paciente com história de cirurgia de catarata complicada, em que uma LIO de 3 peças, inserida no sulco ciliar, se deslocou com o complexo capsular para a cavidade vítrea no pós-operatório.
 Um novo procedimento foi programado, para realizar a fixação intraescleral da LIO da mesma lente deslocada, usando uma técnica chamada fixação em L invertido.
Nesta técnica duas peritomias conjuntivais locais são feitas nasal e temporal. Em seguida, o cirurgião marca dois pontos afastados 180º um do outro, e um sulco escleral em ""L"" é feito de cada lado.
Na sequencia, o cirurgião realiza primeiro um flap escleral do lado temporal.
O flap nasal é feito da mesma forma, mas observe que a incisão em ""L"" é feita no sentido oposto da primeira.
Em seguida, uma paracentese é feita, o viscoelástico é injetado e a LIO é posicionada na câmara anterior acima da íris.
O complexo capsular com anel de Soemmering é então removido com o vitrector, e a vitrectomia pars plana é realizada. 
Após o término da VVPP, duas esclerotomias 20G são feitas bilateralmente a 2 mm do limbo dentro do flap. O háptico nasal da LIO é apreendido através da esclerotomia com ajuda de duas pinças retinianas na técnica de handshake. O segundo háptico da LIO é então externalizado com uma pinça retiniana enquanto o cirurgião segura a primeira.

His lens bag complex is dislocated onto the retina but despite that he sees 20/80 with correction.  I've made a decision to do a closed system pars plana vitrectomy remove the lens bag complex on the retina and do Yamane scleral fixation of an AR40 and then, open sky penetrating keratoplasty immediately after in one surgery done under general anesthesia for quicker recovery.   This whole procedure was done by one surgeon (Safran) and demonstrates a range of techniques from different subspecialties."

Safran MD,"This is a male patient who had Lasik 20 years ago then had cataract surgery with Restor lenses placed about a decade ago.  He never saw well with these lenses but subsequently had extensive YAG laser of the posterior capsule and a ""nick"" placed in the anterior capsule with the YAG laser as well.  These anterior capsule nicks are present in both eyes so I suspect they were intentional and placed to modify the refractive outcome (unsuccessfully).  He also has extensive glistenings in the IOL, a refractive error and  vitreous floaters/turbidity which are all affecting his vision.  He has a 28mm eye so optic capture would be ideal.  In this video I'm going to demonstrate smoothing out of the anterior capsule defect with a vitrector to prevent a radial tear from propagating.  If a radial tear were to develop in this case it would meet up with the posterior capsule extension and cause the capsular bag to split leaving no place to put the new IOL without scleral fixation (which I'd like to avoid).  I'm also going to do a complete PPV for his vitreous floaters/opacities."

Safran MD,This is a patient referred after Femtosecond laser cataract surgery with a Panoptix lens where there was a zonular defect and vitreous prolapse that caused decentration of the lens bag complex with blurred vision compared to the other eye which has a well centered Panoptix that the patient is happy with.  A decision was made to address the vitreous prolapse and recenter and secure the IOL bag complex with gore tex lasso sutures.  I prefer using goretex to flanged prolene in these cases because I feel it gives me better control and is less likely to extrude and cause foreign body sensation or endophthalmitis as the gore tex lies completely under the scleral surface and is easier to control/adjust the tension on to center the lens bag complex.

He has one haptic and about half the optic in the sulcus irritating the iris and the other half of the lens is socked into the capsular bag on the nasal side with the iris fibrosed to the capsule.  There is a posterior capsule defect through which vitreous is herniating.  Despite this the patient refracts to a hazy 20/20- but he is bothered by the blurred vision and discomfort.  We have made a decision to remove and replace this lens, clean up the vitreous and place a new 3 piece lens in the optic capture configuration.  The iris defect is also repaired."

He has had a 3 piece zero power silicone lens placed in the sulcus to protect the iris from the single piece acrylic lens but he continues to have UGH syndrome and bleeding so he has been referred to me for an intervention.  After careful exam I felt that one of the haptics of the Restor lens had eroded through the bag and was irritating the ciliary body causing bleeding so I've made a decision to remove both the IOLs, remove the blood in the eye causing CF vision and place a new 3 piece  IOL in the optic capture configuration where it will not irritate uveal structures.

There is iris damage from the original cataract surgery as the surgeon experienced difficulty with IFIS.   We are going to cut the fibrotic anterior capsule away, do a Pars Plana vitrectomy and remove the damaged lens, replace it and repair the iris.  The patient did very well recovering 20/20-2 uncorrected vision and a good functional/cosmetic repair of the pupil that prevented symptoms of glare that might have been a problem otherwise.

He had a surgical repair at the time has not seen out of this eye since then. He is referred with a large iris defect, a brunescent cataract, a large area of missing zonules and phacodonesis.  The plan is to do phacoemulsification and place an IOL and iris prosthesis if possible in the capsular bag.  The phacoemulsification is performed with capsular support and a CTR placed in the intact capsular bag.  While suturing the CTR in place the trailing end of the Goretex suture as it's being pulled through the sclerotomy cuts the edge of the anterior capsule and causes a radial tear so an alternate strategy of suturing a CZ70BD and the iris prosthesis separately in combination with a Pars Plana vitrectomy is pursued successfully.

DqawJ3Tpghg,iridectomy;pars plana vitrectomy;,IZHV: Iridozonular hyloid vitrectomy and Floaterectomy by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a patient with chronic aqueous misdirection after cataract surgery.  She has a myopic outcome due to the anterior effective IOL position, glaucoma, a shallow anterior chamber and she is bothered by cloudy, turbid vitreous opacities that interfere with her vision.  We have decided to do a pars plana vitrectomy to remove her floaters and to create a unicameral eye to solve her aqueous misdirection related issues.   Here a 3 port PPV is done and we place our trocars only 2.75 mm back from the limbus (rather than the normal 3.5mm or so)  as this is a 21mm eye and we want to stay more anterior to be safe as the pars plana may end a bit more anterior than normal in these shorter eyes.  After a core vitrectomy all the anterior vitreous is removed in the area we want to make our communication between the anterior and posterior segment and the infusion is switched to the anterior chamber to deepen it for creation of an iridectomy.   After the iridectomy is done the vitrector is then used to remove a small portion of the peripheral capsule to create uninterrupted flow between the different chambers of the eye."
P0BkZ5vV-sg,iris repair;goniotomy;,PMMA IOL on retina removed/PPV/Yamane ISHF/ Goniotomy and iris repair by Steven  G. Safran MD,"This is a patient referred with a PMMA lens dislocated onto the retina, a large Soemmering's ring, an iris defect and glaucoma and we are going to do a PPV, removal of the dislocated lens bag complex, replace with Yamane ISHF of a new lens, goniotomy and iris repair.   Good wound integrity is critical for visibility and control during the surgery.  In this case the wound was self sealing but vitreous prolapse through the wound acted like a wick and caused leakage of infusion and loss of pressure.  This problem was recognized however and resolved restoring the wound integrity needed to complete the case."
l4mqZNzJ1w0,cataract surgery;vitrectomy;,Dislocated IOL exchange/optic capture/PPV/floaterectomy  by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a patient who is referred in a few years after cataract surgery complaining about an ""arc"" of light in her temporal visual field that bothers her constantly.  She also has hyperopic astigmatism and is bothered by symptomatic floaters.   Her lens is posteriorly dislocated and the posterior capsule is disrupted with the lens mostly in the vitreous cavity rather than the capsular bag.  A decision has been made to remove this lens, replace with an optic captured 3 piece IOL and do a complete vitrectomy to address her floaters.  an LRI is also performed to reduce her cornea astigmatism."
zI30KIs5r6E,cataract surgery;vitrectomy;,Panoptix problems solved: IOL exchange and floaterectomy by Steven G. Safran MD,"This patient referred from 400 miles away had cataract surgery in both eyes with Panoptix lenses over a year previously.  She has had YAG laser capsulotomy in both eyes and despite having no significant refractive error she sees no better than 20/30 even with glasses and is bothered by poor vision, glare, and halos to the extent that she can no longer do her job or drive at night.  She has been referred for lens exchange and we did the right eye on Monday with a successful outcome and here we are doing the left eye surgery on Thursday of the same week combined with ""floater"" removal via pars plana vitrectomy.  A significant part of her problem in both eyes was the  presence of cloudy vitreous and distracting floaters which affected her vision.  We find that patients with vitreous floaters have greater difficulty with the optics of multifocal lenses and particularly the Panoptix lens so I often remove these with a vitrectomy at the time of exchange ....especially if the posterior capsule is open after YAG laser.  Note that the first still image in this video shows her right eye prior to her lens exchange surgery and the second still image is her left eye which we are operating on today in this video."
arW34J5kIU0,cataract surgery;goniotomy;pars plana vitrectomy;,PPV + tube shunt for intracapsular/vitreous heme and Glaucoma by Steven G. Safran MD,This is a patient referred after previous cataract surgery was performed with a 360 degree goniotomy.  The patient is on Eliquis and there was severe bleeding during the goniotomy procedure.  She had a subsequent AC washout done a week previously but she rebled and IOP was in the high 40s on maximal meds.  She also had an intracapsular hematoma and vitreous hemorrhage limiting her vision to hand motion while IOP remained in the high 30s on oral Diamox/drops.   A decision was made to do a pars plana vitrectomy too remove the blood in the viteous and the capsular bag and place an Ahmed tube at the same time to control the pressure.  Next day vision had improved to 20/50 sc and IOP was 05.
8Fa9Jqjibac,phaco;pars plana vitrectomy;,Post IVI cataract with PC defect converted into posterior rhexis by Steven G. Safran MD,This is a patient referred with the sudden onset of a cataract after an intravitreal injection (IVI) apparently hit the lens and damaged the posterior capsule in her better seeing eye (the one she is dependent on to function).  There appears to be a linear defect visible on slit lamp exam consistent with the path of the needle injection coming from the  inferotemporal direction.  The plan is to do phaco with in the bag placement of the new IOL and to convert the posterior capsule defect into a posterior capsulorhexis  but if necessary we were prepared to do pars plana vitrectomy and optic capture as a backup option.  We will treat this like a polar cataract and avoid hydrodissection or any other maneuvers that distend the posterior capsule or put pressure on it as much as possible during the procedure.

8tD5sfCeUJc,scleral;cataract surgery;,33 g needle guided scleral haptic suture fixation by Steven G,This is a patient who had cataract surgery and the toric IOL that was placed dislocated and was removed by the cataract surgeon on the table and she was left aphakic.  She was referred for a secondary IOL placement.  There is a radial tear at 6:00 that extends around to the posterior capsule but the anterior hyaloid is intact.  A 3 piece Softport A0 will be placed in the sulcus and one haptic sutured to sclera using a 33g needle guided technique.  This will allow the anterior capsule that is present to support the lens without concern that the lens might rotate into the capsule defect and decenter.

He is missing 1/3 of his iris and most of his temporal zonules and there is a suspected breach in his anterior hyloid.  He has been referred for cataract surgery and iris repair.   The cataract surgery is performed using a Malyugin modified CTR sutured with gore tex to the scleral wall to secure the lens, a Toric lens is placed and then iris repair is undertaken using a technique of loading a 10-0 prolene into the lumen of a 33g needle."
I5vxhD8c4Mk,scleral;iridotomy;,ACIOL removed and replaced with Yamane ISHF by Steven G. Safran MD,This is an anterior chamber lens that is fibrosed in place and causing pain and inflammation.  The lens is dissected out and replaced with a Yamane instrascleral fixated Zeiss CT Lucia 602.  The patient is on Coumadin and bleeds rather easily and also has a deep set eye making maneuevers more difficult.   There is also a large iridotomy that created some optical issues that is closed using a 10-0 prolene suture.  No sutures were used to close the scleral tunnel incision here but conjunctiva was closed at the end with 2 10-0 nylon sutures (not shown).
Fug0ude94yo,scleral;cataract surgery;,Soemmerring's ring from Hell by Steven G.Safran MD,"This is a patient referred with chronic uveitis, glaucoma, CME 16 years post cataract surgery and now he has  a dislocated lens bag complex in the posterior segment of the eye.  His pupil does not dilate more than what you see at the start of the video so it's difficult to get a good view of the posterior segment but he has had previous retina detachment repair.   I decided to place iris retractors and make a self sealing scleral tunnel to try to remove the lens bag complex after bringing it up from the posterior segment but ther hard part of this case was dealing with the blackest, densest, nastiest Soemmering's ring material I've ever encountered.   I suspect that this was the cause of much of his chronic inflammation."

I lassoed the complex as shown in this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMQuS8n8PWs.  2 years later the lens has calcified and needs to be replaced.   The Goretex sutures will be cut, the lens bag complex removed, pars plana vitrectomy carried out and the new lens placed with Yamane intrascleral haptic fixation.  The patient had an excellent visual outcome with complete preservation of the filtering bleb.   I did the original phaco trabeculectomy here in 2007 and the lasso procedure in 2015."

We are doing a vitrectomy followed by surgery with capsule retractors, placement of a gore tex sutured Malyugin modified CTR  and then placement of a Toric IOL.   An iStent is placed and then a pars plana vitrectomy carried out."
I8JmlHc7f9M,phaco;iris repair;,Hemi Cerclage iris repair by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a patient with an regional diffuse iris atrophy and thinning from HSV keratouveitis.  The iris was adherent to the anterior capsule and here after dissecting the iris off of the capsule, doing phaco and placing a Toric IOL the iris is repaired by doing 2 ""hemi"" cerclage sutures.  The areas where the iris sphincter was intact were left alone to preserve some pupil function.   The other areas were very thin and atrophic from iris thinning and atrophy.  Placing 2 ""hemi"" cerclage sutures allows me to retain some pupil function and bring the pupil down to reduce  glare and improve cosmesis without creating a ""fixed"" pupil. This is fast and relatively easy to do.  Additional sutures can be added if needed.  2 hemi cerclage sutures were chosen over a single full cerclage suture to preserve sphincter function in the areas where they were intact."
woCtRdClr50,scleral;pars plana vitrectomy;,Needle guided Lasso of IOL/Bag complex by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a high myope who has had pars plana vitrectomy and a scleral buckle for a retina detachment and subsequently developed instability of the lens bag complex with pseudophacodonesis.   When he lies back he can see the edge of the lens as the capsular bag swings back on the nasal side.   As this is an active, relatively young patient a decision has been made to stabilize this before further dislocation occurs (which in a vitrectomized eye could be sudden and total requiring a more complex repair).  This is done using a 30 g needle guided lasso technique with a gore tex suture."

Here the IOL will be exchanged for a 3 piece silicon lens, pars plana vitrectomy will be performed and an iris cerclage carried out.  This was successful in eliminating the patients glare problem and the patient was very happy with the functional and cosmetic outcome provided by this surgery."
BUaSCNzOmHY,penetrating keratoplasty;cataract surgery;,Buphthalmic eye cataract surgery by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a monocular patient with a history of congenital glaucoma.  The other eye was lost as a child and he has a prosthesis there.  In this buphthalmic eye he had a penetrating keratoplasty done one year earlier for Haab's striae, very high astigmatism and stromal haze and a decision has been made to leave the running suture in place when doing the cataract surgery as he now has minimal astigmatism (1 diopter) and I felt it would help add some protection to the eye against wound dehiscence.  The surgery goes very well but during the insertion of the CTR there is a split in the posterior capsule that goes around to the anterior capsule creating a radial tear.  A decision is made to place a Staar lens within the capsular bag balancing it on the remaining capsule and positioning the haptic so that they are well supported without further extending the radial tear and this is successful.  The patient has done extremely well post operative with no change in position of the implant and 20/25 uncorrected visual acuity.  I've posted this video to accompany an Eyeworld grand rounds article that will be forthcoming about this case."

Safran MD,This is a post lasik patient who has suffered blunt trauma to the right eye and now has subluxed cataract with a large zonular dialysis and prolapse of the hyaloid face into the anterior chamber along with some dislocation of the lens as well.   Cataract surgery is performed with placement of a CTR and 2 sutured CTS.   One CTS is sutured with 9-0 prolene and the other with Gore tex.  A vitrectomy is avoided by preserving the anterior hyaloid face during the surgery.  By the way....that's a bullfrog in the backround making all that noise during my voiceover....just in case you were wondering.....lives in a pond underneath the office I was doing the video edit in.

Safran MD,"This is a patient with incarcerated iris and a local descemets detachment who after cataract surgery referred for severe glare and disfigured appearance to the eye.  The patient waited 6 months for his surgery because of his schedule and the procedure was performed successfully by dissecting the iris off the back of the cornea and reconstructing with 4 interrupted 10-0 prolene sutures tied with sliding slip knots.  The knots are triple throw, single  throw, single throw here then cut with a microscissor. Note that the second placed suture patches together 3 segments.....including the piece of iris tissue that was posterior to the incision to create a better repair than just closing along the defect in a straight line.    The patients glare symptoms completely resolved with the procedure."
pMQuS8n8PWs,phaco;trabeculectomy;pars plana vitrectomy;,Gore Tex  suture Lasso of Dislocated Akreos IOL/bag complex by Steven G. Safran MD,"This is a patient with pseudoexfoliation and glaucoma who had a successful combined phaco trabeculectomy with mitomycin C done by myself 4 years earlier.  His pressure had been in the 30s on medication prior to surgery and between 8 and 10 since then consistently so we cannot risk sacrificing the bleb.  He presents with a dislocated lens/capsular bag complex and by the time we get him to the O.R. there is vitreous in the anterior chamber and the lens has sunken significantly into the vitreous cavity.  The lens is floated up with viscoelastic so that it can be lassoed on one side, then the other side taking care not to damage the bleb.  The proximal side is then lassoed again incorporating both ear like haptics as initially the lens did not center well.  Gore Tex CV-8 suture was used here with a TTc -9 needle bent with needle holders into a more useful profile.  After completion of the securing of the IOL/Bag complex a pars plana vitrectomy is carried out.  The next day the IOP was 12 and and the implant was well centered."

I have that this tip cuts extremely efficiently through dense cataracts with ease and that very little phaco energy is required to do these cases.  Here we use only 8.1 seconds of effective phaco time and the cornea is crystal clear day one with 20/20 vision.  The AMO ZCBOO lens goes through the 2.2mm incision with no requirement for ""wound assist"" and no tearing of the incision results."
cY_5tfGU_fE,lasik;cataract surgery;,Trulign Crystalens Toric cataract surgery by Steven G Safran MD,"This is a patient who has had previous lasik on whom I am performing cataract surgery with a Trulign Crystalens toric intraocular lens.  This case demonstrates my preferred rhexis size which is slightly smaller than the optic with 360 degree overlap as well as the methods I use to remove cortical material and lens epithelial cells as completely as possible.  I like to vacuum under the anterior capsule rim, then jet the posterior capsule clear of LECs with BSS from a 27 g cannula and then after the IOL is placed I use the Safran-Singer sweep to remove the remaining LECs from the anterior capsule.  One of the advantages of this toric is the ease at which one can adjust it within the bag to fine tune it's alignment.  It can be easily rotated in either direction even after the viscoelastic has been completely removed to perfectly align it on the intended axis to correct astigmatism."

Part of the hyperopia is due to the lens sitting more posteriorly due to a large zonular dialysis that is allowing vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber and to the wound across the front of the implant (from 4 to 9:00 O'clock in this right eye).  Here a decision was made to scleral fixate the CTR to reposition it more anterior (changing it's effective lens position and reducing the hyperopia to +0.25.)
